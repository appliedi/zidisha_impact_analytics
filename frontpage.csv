In all these struggles, my dream is to be able to work hard and build a better home someday.i sell or deal in sachet water but on a small scale. Actually people drink a lot of water in a day and as they drink so is my business to supply at a profit. i choose this kind of business because of the profit involve and also at the time i was starting out, the capital to start was minimal. possibly i buy about hundred Bags of sachet water with a hundred Dollars. and after sales, i will make 50% to 70% percent profit on the amount of money invested. i still help my parents with some of my profits for them to take care of themselves and my younger brothers and i invest the rest back into my business and live also on a percentage of it. the most important thing in this sachet water business is Hard working and that has never been a problem at all with me.As i have much hope and believe that my loan project will be funded, i will use the entire amount to go for bags of sachet water as stock to resell..... i will be buying 250 bags of sachet water or pure water as we call it locally. now the 250 bags will cost $300 and i will use the rest to purchase some soft drink like canned coke, fanta , pepsi and etc but that will occupy just a small portion of it about $30 this will help increase my profit margin to about some 45% and will help make treated drinking water available to the people of my community. with this i will be able to stay in business and work hard so as to be able to get to the point where i will be selling sachet water as a retailer. with this current profit margin, i will be able to repay my loan on time and per schedule. thank you very much....",0.72391274299551189
