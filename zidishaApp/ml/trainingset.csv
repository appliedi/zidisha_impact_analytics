Samuel had dropped out of form one when I took him, and his brother Godfrey had joined street boys in Eldoret after dropping out of school in class four, as he had already given up in life because he had nowhere to turn to. To prove the world wrong, he was the top student on the KCPE exams in Gombe primary school with 365 points.I am requesting for a second loan to expand my poultry farming in the village.

Samuel is waiting to graduate in November. All this was possible with the help of my first loan from Zidisha. Big up to Zidisha team.

I am married with two children. Currently I am employed as a civil servant in Nakuru County.Despite being employed, I noticed that I could not meet all my rising needs thus I decided to engage in Dairy farming and more so though difficult I bought 2 plots. My main target is to start building rental rooms and I have started by buying materials i.e. stones worth US 1,041 from my savings. God willing I intend to start this work before the end of this year, of which after completing I am sure to reap good money.As indicated in my story, I engage in dairy farming which earns me some income which caters for some needs and bills e.g water and electricity. I also do some farming for my home consumption.My anticipated rental rooms which are on a prime area i.e. Nakuru-Eldoret high way will give me enough income to cater for my childrens' school fees and to expand this business by buying other plots for the same.To rent one room costs Ksh. US.23 x 10 rooms = 230 per month for 1 plot. Therefore If I finish the two plots building it will earn me US. 463  per month. Of course this is good money even to repay my loan and have extras.The challenge to this project is now the money to buy cement and for the mason.Before I finish these rooms I will use my salary to repay my loan.Having notedone that dairy farming earns good income I  opted to engage myself fully. I also rear bulls for meat because I got a tender to supply  a  nearby school at leaSt one per week. I normally buy at a lowere price when they are young. I rear them waiting  the supply. I make a good profit of about ksh 3000-6000 depending on the weight of the bull. Therefore my anticipated loan will partly be used to renovate my dairy shed and the rest buy small calf's for rearing.I do hope betweven 8-10 months I will be selling the same at good price.",0.41850607527832762,0.90804389740358693,1

I remember being caught by mother one day who punished me for not doing something constructive with my free time like studying for the next exam , this is because they always consider bright students in our community to pursue formal education and not so much of talent. I was never deterred from pursuing my interest in hair dressing so I saved my pocket money to go ahead and study hairdressing and beauty therapy in a formal setup, this didn't happen because it wasn't enough so I paid a neighbor who owns a salon in the neighborhood who helped me enhance my talent. it came out well and now I'm running my own small hairdressing salon  in my house where I stay. There are challenges but with the support of my siblings who have now seen that talent can be nurtured against all odds to be a brilliant business opportunity that can pay bills, i'm able to sail through.whats more interesting is that my 19 years old daughter who is currently pursuing a course in education is also interested in beauty therapy and intends to take a course in it, with that I believe my unfulfilled dream of going through formal education in the same will be fulfilled through her achievement. I'm glad that at least there will be someone to carry on the talent as I'm told it was my mother who used to do womens' hair during her youth so i took after her but now in form of business not leisure.My business is a hairdressing salon situated in my residential house, we do :cornrow, braids, weaving, hair relaxing , blow drying and shaving,.these are the most commonly demanded hair styles in the neighborhood because all women of different earnings can afford and maintain them and again they convenient for the African hair.typically my revenue comes from the charges for the hair done and sometimes if I have stock of beauty products which I rarely do due to their expensive nature and again many may consider them unnecessary. My charges vary from as little as ksh 200  for children's' hairdo to ksh 1000 for twists and braids,.I mostly spend on buying shampoo and other hair products to be used on clients' hair this on average costs ksh 3500 per month, electricity bill costing between ksh 1000 to ksh 1500 a month I also have employed 2 employees paid ksh 3000 plus 10% commission. on a good month's work I make an average of ksh 30000 from which I would deduct all the expenses leaving an average profit of ksh 19000, these profits I use partially to pay for my children's  school fees, daily upkeep and home improvement.I wish to expand my salon to the level of a beauty parlour or even a spar but financing is the main problem coupled with family responsibilities and hard economic times it is hard to reinvest the profits 100% into the business.I love this kind of business because it is my passion I find fulfillment in doing it , moreover it puts food on my table, my children go to good schools which we could not afford if we only depended on their father's salary .I will top up to buy a better state of the art water heater to add to  the one I'm currently using  for efficiency. it goes ksh. 3000, it saves power by turning off automatically once the water is boiled this saves on electricity bill.",0.69895061458944907,0.0,1

I am a Kenyan citizen who was born in a village called Kogelo in Awendo. I went to Bongu primary school and passed well in Kenya Certificate of Primary Education. Later I joined Suba Academy in Rusinga Island for Secondary Studies but due to the death of my mother who I depended on, I could not manage to pay school fee. I joined World Wide ICT training Centre, and passed well.  Since I could not move on well with life due to lack of job, I joined group of fishermen just to have something on the table (food). It was hard indeed, but I persistently continued with fishing in spite of the challenges I faced in the lake, especially dangerous animals like hippos that could attack us while fishing. I started saving whatever little I was getting, and I maneuvered to start a small computer shop. I was focused, dedicated and hardworking. I thought it wise to start offering computer services which was lacking in the area. I progressed day by day and today, I am offering computer training. Classes are moving on well and my vision is to have a spacious room to accommodate more learners.I am optimistic that through Zidisha I will make it, and achieve my goal.Currently, I am running a small Cybercafe. The people in the region could not access such services in the nearby town, forcing them to travel far towns in search of such services. That  is what derived me, to start a Cybercafe. Today, many people are happy with my services. They neither walk long distances nor spend more money on fare in search of such services.The challenges I am facing, is majorly on rental costs which are charged highly. But as the business progress, I will scheme on building a ICT center so that I don't spend much on rental.Being that we are living in an Island of Rusinga along the lake shore where the source of living is fishing, this has been the source of HIV/AIDS which has killed many people in this area. Poverty level is very high causing poor mothers to go out for fishermen for financial support of the family. This has cause the spread of sexual diseases and hence HIV/AIDS pandemic. The scourge has left many children as orphans.These orphaned children are living under very difficult and pathetic conditions, as some of them could not find food properly. They could not find time to go to school due to hunger; neither could they get school uniforms or even clothing to put on.As an ICT Centre I have come forward to play a pivotal role in ensuring that these children are computer literate and encourage them educationally through provision of books, pens and sometimes giving them some money for their school fees. If Zidisha fund me, I will advance the project and the extend to other regions so that these young people get education.The loan applied for shall used to buy Cybercafe items that will boost the business hence take us to a higher level.

For a long time I had to take care of my siblings and I had to work and continue with the same business.I had to pay rent for them, my school fees, food and others. I remember sometimes I could not even raise money for my fare to town or lunch but I sacrificed until them and I had reached somewhere to start life.I thereafter changed my business to selling second hand clothes to cater for extra needs I have right now since the fish business was too cumbersome and needed a lot of time which I could not combine with work. I have actually raised money from my salary to start this business after my employment.In my community girls are not recognizes to be assisted to go to school and things became worse when  I became a widow in 2014.Widows in luo land are supposed to be inherited and continue giving birth at their own cost. This has made me remain a widow and a single mother to protect myself and my children from the crazy community culture and also protect my children from any person taking advantage of me and my children since my first born daughter is now a teenage ,a candidate to be precise.Because of this I must confine myself to the city and not at my husbands village since the community cannot stand us neither can we agree to their culture.This calls for a die-hard kind of life to make things work for me and hence work and do business to make ends meet.My daughter who is a candidate in class eight right now would want to be a lawyer and my wish is to support her all through to achieve this. She is enrolled in a private school and I have bills to pay and considering the Kenyan economy salary is never  enough for a single mother.My commitment right now is to make my children successful to maintain the legacy of my husband hence work and business.Having been employed as an administrative assistant, I realized that that salary is not enough and I decided to start selling second hand clothes which is a popular business in Kisumu where I stay. Second hand clothes are always n demand compared to other clothes being sold around but the challenge being that those who are interested are very busy to tussle themselves to select the clothes in the market therefore they prefer someone doing the delivery for them. I target people from other offices and even in church, am also privileged because I dont need to employee anyone to sell for me since I do so at my free time and during weekends and holidays when am off duty hence no manpower to eat on my profit .The clothes are affordable and negotiable and any amount can purchase them, A reasonable and presentable for my clients would cost me ksh.200 which can attract a revenue ksh.100.With this revenue I am able to subsidize my salary to pay my bills, save for my children education and any other floating expenses that my salary cannot settle.As a single mother I have been able to maintain to children in the private school and I am sure that their interest is taken care of.Although I buy from the region where I stay-kisumu,I would like to do my purchases from Nairobi where costs are lower with variety so that I can increase my revenue. For me to achieve this I need to sell more and save even more so that I can purchase from Nairobi since it will attract some extra expenses compared to buying from the near market.As a self motivated single mother any assistance to realize my dream will make me realize the dream of my children and there is nothing am committed to as such right nowSince my target right now is to save for more stock I will use this loan to buy and sell from the market to increase my stock and eventually hope to achieve my business target of buying my clothes from Nairobi for a higher margin and more stability.It will be an additional capital added to what I have to make sure that I buy variety to attract more revenue. This additional capital will make me purchase some of the clothes that my clients would always need but I would not be able to go for because of lack of enough capital to buy. I can now be able to do a mix of official and casual ware to make sure that I maximize on my turn over and in the process create more clientele and more revenue at last with this type of market attack I can expand faster compared to when I stick on to the traditional way I have been doing it.Am sure my business will have improved a lot.I am therefore convinced that if I plough back the same revenue for some time into the business meeting my target will not be a struggle and therefore my dreams as a single mother and of my children to be financially stable.ie each clothe is ksh.200=5more clothes in my stock turning to a revenue of about ksh.100*5=500 per time of purchase and sale.",0.67035927233483994,0.75262845808413825,1

My parents are Mr. Emmanuel Panti and Comfort Aniniwa, all from the same village. I had my basic education in the same town and later moved to Accra the capital town of Ghana to start life. Life was not as easy but by the grace of God, I moved on. Here in Accra, I went into second hand clothing selling at kantamanto and later on I met my adorable wife with whom I have four lovely children. My wife's name is Rebecca Eduah and my children are George Panti, Winifred Twum, Kwaku Eduah and Kwasi Twum. I was introduced to this business by a friend whom I met in Accra, he taught how to go about going for the right clothes that the customers may want or needed. In beginning it was not easy but as I grew in the business I came to understand it better.Ghana is a wonderful country, the people are warm, welcoming and friendly. We also appreciate strangers a lot. There are so many things I could say of my country but I hope to end here.My main business has always been selling of second hand clothing and I must say it is a good business here in Ghana. I have been in this business for the pass twenty years and still do it. And this business has helped raise my four children through school and everything. I want to move into farming as well. I have over four acres of land in my home town of which one acre is currently being used for palm fruit and plantain growing. I wish to get some finances to move into a bit serious farming on that. Farming is the backbone of the Ghanaian economy, this ensures sustainable living in the villages as well as the cities. The income goes a long way to help take care of the family as well as the family properties.Palm fruits are so useful in many ways, therefore, venturing into it ensures a better future for my family and the rewards are great. Typically cost involves labours, tools and maintenance of the farm in terms of weedicede, pesticede to control weeds and pest.I am thankful for the previous load given to me and I am happy to be working with you. Today, I am willing to take on another project which has always been my work before I decided to start farming. I have experience in selling used clothings and at this season of the year, it becomes profitable selling used clothing in our country. I have therefore, decided to go back into the business in the last quater of the year.A bill of clothing is costing seven hundred to nine hundred Ghana cedis(GHC 700 - GHC 900) depending on the grade. Each bill of clothing consists of same product, therefore, there are shirts, ladies clothings, trousers etc. My plan is to buy at least three different bills in order to meet the needs of the various market.This will help me, extend my clothing business and to have constant income whiles I wait for my farming to mature. It will ensure my prompt repayment of my loans. I hope my loan will be granted as always. Thank you.",0.70146669628293845,0.81406432882078417,1

I have a strong passion for agriculture with the sole aim of raising income to support needy but brilliant students both in my school and hometown.My farm is a five hectare cashew plantation which was secured two years  ago. I have started making proceeds from two hectares of the farm.Cashew is a very important cash crop in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. It has a high market demand and has improved the lives of various people. It is less tedious and less laborious to farm cashew as compared to other cash crops.

She was to live with disability for 19 years upto 1997 when she died. From her I picked up one thing that business was the only sure way to make it through if formal employment was not coming forth. I have been on and off temp jobs and self employment. But I now want to settle in business fully. I have five children three boys and two girls. The elder boy and his follower have the desire of making it big in business and thus the need to set the business rolling before they finish school.My business involve selling and distribution of packaging materials to kiosks/shops and vegetable vendors. I settled on this since everybody needs to have a polythene bag to carry or package the goods (s)he has purchased. The demand for this is very high. I need to expand to a level where I am able to wholesale. The profit range from the smallest  is between 10% to 30% gross depending on distance of distribution.

My long term objective is to be able to meet the educational needs of my children besides meeting family needs  and growing to big shop merchandise.I am glad to put it that I have been able to finish the first circle of my loan before the scheduled date and have now applied for the second circle . I do wish to state that this loan amount would be able to help take an inventory and add new stock.

My growing up was not very smooth due to a meager income my parents would survive on from their peasant farming practices. With my 2 brothers we learnt to support ourselves while still very young to supplement our parents little income thus to keep us in school and still have something to eat at home.These childhood struggles imparted in me a strong urge to excel in whatever thing i lay my hands to do. I started my business by keeping rabbits before i mixed them up with chicken. I am currently a proud mother because my children cannot go hungry. Thus growth is my business choice at this point in time.My dreams are to be the major supplier of both eggs and broillers to all the retailers in Kakamega countyI keep chicken for both meat and eggs. I started this business 3 years ago. I started small with only  2 layers (chicken). I have managed to grow this to 40 chicken. I started this business due to the poor background we grew up in. Affording two meals in a day was a nightmare. I wouldn't wish this for my kids.The biggest challenge are the harsh weather conditions which in most cases call for rapid change of the poultry housing conditions.My customers include domestic consumers, schools and institution staffs plus shop keepers who buy eggs from me for sale.I currently have 40 chicken my vision is to grow them to 200 chicken in the next 3 months and 400 chicken in the next 4 months.I am most proud of this business because of the positive results i have enjoyed from the same this far. In a good month i make profits of upto $ 200 which is use to expand the business and the rest to cater for the family needsI am going to invest this loan into the poultry farming wing of my business. I intend to purchase an additional 400 broiler chicks which will cost me around $400I have realized full market for chicken meat. currently am not able to meet the demand for this product. Soon we will be into the end of year festivities, i intend to reap maximum profits through this business.The profits will be used to expand my business further especially the other wings of rabbits and dairy.This loan is going to change my business perspective from a small scale farmer to large scale poultry and dairy farmer.Thank you zidisha lenders for the milestone move in my business.",0.21874207495393971,-0.072951239890450936,1

I attended the Nangina girls secondary school and later joined Bumbe TTI where I followed a certificate course in secretarial and computer. I thereafter got a job as a cashier in a supermarket. My income as a cashier is very meager and hardly sustains my needs, I therefore decided in January of this year, 2014, to venture into commercial farming and started with 30 indigenous chicken just in my house. I used to live with them in the same house until when I started supplying my employer with fertilized eggs, soon the demand for my products soared and I could not meet the demand as I wished any longer. In May, from my sales I decided to take the business seriously and put up a poultry house for my chicken. I now own 100 chicken but I want to expand the venture to 1000 chicken. I am planning to resign from my job as a cashier to focus on my business, however the major hurdle is finances and hopefully Zidisha will help compliment my finance mobilization. During my free time I like visiting established poultry farmers, swimming, making friends and be on social media.I would like to thank Zidisha founders for this kind gesture and for having vulnerable groups at heart and to the Zidisha lenders please be honest and service your loans for someone else will need it in future.My major source of income is poultry farming, I have 100 indigenous chickens. I sell chicks (less than a month old) and eggs to generate revenue for my business and myself.My clients include individuals, supermarkets and breeders who buy my eggs for breeding purposes. My products are fairly priced and that gives me a competitive edge against my competitors. The major risk and uncertainties facing my business is theft and diseases, however I am putting up security measures to minimize this vice and as to diseases I am vaccinating my chicken against all prevalent diseases in my county.My expenses per month are $150 to cater for feeds, security and vaccines, my revenue from eggs and chicks sales is $280 a month, I make $130 in profit. I also earn $80 from my employment job as a cashier and I expect to use my profit and salary to service my loan.I take this opportunity to most sincerely thank you for supporting me in my previous loans. My business is growing steadily and my revenues have increased by 300%. I am requesting for a loan to buy freezer for my business expansion to including slaughtering of chicken for easy transportation to the capital city.

This is about 200km from our capital city. I am 40 years. I ventured into poultry business after working in a few companies which were often being closed down due to recession and I decided to venture to self employment.  I plan of starting to venture into dairy industry and I plan to buy about 2 cows at first and progressively expand, but that is a story for another day.I am married to my loving wife Mercy and we have two daughters - Kathy and Emmy, Kathy is 6 years and is going to school and Emmy  is 4 years, she joined baby class this year and she is very excited about the new school!My first bone daughter Kathy tells me that she would like to be a pilot and Emmy says  she would like to be a doctor when they grow up!I love travelling and and nature expeditions, I especially ornithology - birdwatching very much.I am a poultry farmer from Nakuru - Kenya. I normally keep free range chicken because they do not need much and are resistant to most diseases.I have a total of about420 chicken currently and I started with slightly less than 200 when I join Zidisha, through the loans that I acquired from Zidisha, I have been able to expand my business progressively.This has turned out to be a full time job for me and I have even employed one person to be assisting me.The project has not only made me be able to put food on the table, it has enabled me to take my young girls to school but also made me realize that in everything we do, so long as we are dedicated we can make it.My goal is to be able to supply chicken eggs and meat to my immediate neighborhood and eventually open up my business to include incubation and chicken feed formulation.My next ambition and challenge is to venture into dairy farming that is by buying a cow or two so that I can sell raw milk and later I can do value addition by selling yorghut and cheese.The profits have been increasing steadily and this has enabled my wife also start her own clothing shop in our neighbourhood.Hallo to all the Zidisha Team and all the lenders. I am very happy beyond what words can express to let you know that I have just completed paying my third (3rd) loan for buying a water tank.The water tank has been of tremedous benefit for me and my family as this enabled us to collect safe drinking water at an arm's length. This obviously reduced the waterborne diseases like diarrhea and cholera.The second and most important was that my poultry business improved because at no time did my chicken lack water. This in turn increased the number of eggs/birds and the growth rate was very fast and I was able to make more profits.I had projected that I wanted to have about 300 chickens by the end of 2016 but, I would like to report that by June 2016 I had 420 mature chickens and lots of chicks. I therefore collect approximately 8 trays (240 eggs) of fertilized eggs on a daily basis.Most of my customers have been asking why I do not sell them chicks as they would like to emulate my project. This has therefore made me to request my fourth (4th) loan for the purchase of an Automatic Egg Incubator. This is to make my business an All Round One Stop Shop for Poultry from eggs, chicks and chicken meat.Most of the eggs are bought by customers out of town for consumption and incubation. The rest, I normally hire an incubator and after hatching them, I sell one chick at $1 as opposed to selling 5 eggs at $1.However if I get a loan from Zidisha, I will have economics of scale and be able to sell most of my eggs as chicks which is value addition, depending on the market forces, this will be a profitable business.The type of incubator that I intend to buy is the 1056 Automatic Eggs Incubator. The number 1056 is the number of it's capacity of eggs but you only keep about 176 for one row or 352 eggs for two rows every week. This incubator adjusts it's humidity, temperature, turn eggs and you can be having chicks on a weekly basis depending on your customer demands.After I acquire this incubator, I will now venture into another project; as the saying goes you do not keep all your eggs in one basket!I therefore take this opportunity to kindly request all the lenders to extend your generous hand and lead me the loan of $800.The loan break-down is as follows:-1. Cost of Incubator...........................................$7002. Electrical wiring,switch and socket..........................$803.

We must be independent from the operations we evaluate and report to the highest level in an organisation: senior managers and governors. Typically this is the board of directors or the board of trustees, the accounting officer or the audit committee.To be effective, the internal audit activity must have qualified, skilled and experienced people who can work in accordance with the Code of Ethics  and the International Standards.The nature of internal auditing, its role within the organisation and the requirements for professional practice are contained within the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF). The components and the detailed content of the IPPF are available in the Global professional guidance area of the website.nternal auditors deal with issues that are fundamentally important to the survival and prosperity of any organisation. Unlike external auditors, they look beyond financial risks and statements to consider wider issues such as the organisation's reputation, growth, its impact on the environment and the way it treats its employees.In sum, internal auditors help organisations to succeed. We do this through a combination of assurance and consulting. The assurance part of our work involves telling managers and governors how well the systems and processes designed to keep the organisation on track are working. Then, we offer consulting help to improve those systems and processes where necessary.I wish to obtain a loan of Kshs. 1,050/ 10.3 USD to buy spare part  for motorcycle which i used for my personal transportation.Benefit of Owning personal motorcycle1.

And I found that, the children of that village need educational foundation for their future, because there was no any single school by then, they even havent had a dream to get school at their village. So it kicked my heart and made up my mind to establish a new school for the children, and as we all known, education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom. Therefore, I did not have any right to do anything by myself, so I went to the following elders at  the village, Nana Afrifa Agyei, Nana Rose Adu, Nana Kwadwo Ntim and Mad. Joyce Kaakyire to discuss about the school and how it may be established, and they were so glad. Many thanks to the above mentioned names for a free land they gave to me to established this school.

Some villages nearby parents are bringing their wards to this noble school to build their foundation. Now I have employed five (5) teachers. Respectfully, I called all the parents to informed them about the fees and they agreed with me to pay it accordingly. As I am speaking now, the school is well managing, improving and precisely as well.Since this school established till now, it is well known across Nkosookrom village.

I hold a Bachelors In Education from Nairobi university and due to graduate in August with a Masters from the same. After my first degree graduation, I took up a job at Lutheran World Federation as an Administrator in Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya. During my free time, I used to do Online freelance work that mostly constituted research. I decided to switch fully to this business after my Contract with Lutheran World Federation ended. This is what I currently do. I have been making the steps to formalize and increase productivity in my income generating engagement, utilizing the knowledge and skills I gained from Training and work to gradually perfect the art.I run a personal online research business. One of the aspects of the business is gathering of academic material, online tutorials and academic assistance to students. I research and report in various disciplines that include Education, Nursing, History, Business, Marketing, Technology and Natural Sciences among others. For every report generated per research, I get paid a variable cost per page that is calculated by the number of pages, discipline, complexity and academic level of the research. The main resources I utilize is an unlimited internet connection and a laptop computer. The main advantage of this business is that, besides the aforementioned  resources, there are no other major resources required, apart from research skills and academic knowledge. Besides regular internet and electric bills, there are no other major expenditures, increasing probability of profit. Typically, I spend approximately Ksh.8000 (90 USD) on associated bills. The income ranges between Ksh.30,000 ($290) and Ksh.40,000 ($380) every month. I use a significant amount of the income for bills and supporting my brother in college. I also manage to save some for future expansion plans.I intend to set up an office from where I will dispense my research services. Currently, I  work from the house if am not meeting my client. My help also works from his house and we coordinate over skype, email and social media, when he is not at my place. I have decided to work from an office where clients can come if I can't go to them, as an alternative and for convenience and trust building. I have identified an office at Lumumba Drive, Roysambu that costs Ksh.15,000 a month (Approximately USD. 150). To use the office one is required to pay 2 months deposit and a month of rent. I currently have in my possession office seats, a working table and office stationery. I also have a month's rent. I will use the loan for the 2 months deposit that totals to Ksh.30,000(USD.300).  I will also use the Ksh.6000 for the city council business permit. Having a physical and official working location will help me build more trust with my customers. It will also be positive for my work culture, discipline and daily production assessment. With higher trust, I expect referrals from clients for whom I have worked to increase. I will also be able to manage my work well with my help working beside me. I also intend to get a second employee and the work place will be appropriate for a growing team. The lowest I make for a research paper is usually Ksh.8,,000 (USD.80) and an increase in referrals even by one is highly sought after. I look forward to your support.

I was born in a rural area where I grew up accustomed to fairly good infrastructure like electricity and paved roads. In spite of relative good life in my childhood, I faced  a number of challenges like lack of playing fields due to poor planning by the local authorities and I grew up deprived what would be considered as the basic necessities of a growing child.  That notwithstanding, my parents raised me well and imparted good values early life.I went to rural schools both for primary and secondary schools because my parents feared I would get involved in drug taking which was rampant in our neighborhood.  I later joined a polytechnic where I did a three year course in civil engineering.  I was hoping to secure a good job after the completing the course after my father's footsteps but I was not as lucky.  I decided to use our house backyard to start poultry keeping which remarkable success.This is what I am still doing to date and I have no regrets for doing so since it brings food on the table and I also get a lot of satisfaction from the job.I am married with two kids both who are in school.I rear broiler chicken as well as geese in my house backyard.  I sell broilers to local hotels and to residents within the residential estates.  Mombasa is a fast growing city and it has all the demands of big city and one of these is fast food.  I saw this opportunity and decided to exploit it.  The living standards of the residents has also improved in the recent past and a good number of residents have a much better bargaining power as compared to yesteryears. What used to be a preserve of the rich (like chicken) is now a common dish among many.  I keep broilers that take between 5-6 weeks to mature.  I normally buy them when they are one day old and if the survival rate is good (about or above 95%), I make about $150 per brood.  I use the geese to provide eggs that I sell to support the family when I am not selling the chicken.  I am glad I have a ready market of loyal clients in hotels and also in the residential areas.  If funded, I like to keep two sets of broilers and separate then within two weeks so as to ensure a continuous sale of the chicken instead of waiting for 6 weeks interval.  However, for me to do this, I need to get a helping hand in form of affordable credit and this is where Zidisha comes in.I have increased my flock of chicken to slightly more than 400 birds.  Given this money, I will use all of it to buy chicken mash and some raw material that I can use to produce some chicken feed.

I was born on the 6th of November in 1988, which means I am 26 years old now. I have got 4 siblings; two elder sister and two elder brothers. Then I have got my mom and dad too. I'm mostly close with my sister, as she's the only sister I have. However, I do love my brothers too and make the most of it whenever I am with them. I have been living and studying in Jinijini until I was in 7th class (14 years old), then I moved to Berekum with my family. I finished off my high school and took 4 years in University of Cape Coast, then I moved back to Jinijini again. It just didn't work out with me and my family. So now I am in Accra and I have started learning  website design . The field I am thinking to study in is; Geographic Information System (GIS). I love going to school and I have always taken my studies very seriously. I have never said to anyone in my life, that 'I hate studies'. Many people find me as a geek, but I only see that as a compliment rather than an insult. I have got big dreams, when it comes to studies. Since I was 6 years old, I decided to be a geographer. So that is my goal and I always try to aim to do my best at school, so hopefully my hard work will pay off in the end. I don't really know why I decided to be a geographer. I just love land surveying. Although I do feel very sorry whenever I see the poor people in my area die by flood. I care to develop land plan that will solve the problems and educate them about haphazardly putting up building in water ways that trigger flood when there is copious rainfall. Some interests I have got are; reading books, watching movies, cooking and praying. I love to read books, because books can always be true friends. They never demand neither do they complain. This is the way I look upon books. Mostly I read novels. Currently I am reading a novel called ""The Blind Assasin"". Moving on to favorite movies; Titanic, Romeo & Juliet, Crash, Twilight. Basically the list can go on and on. I must be up to date with the latest movies. Cooking has been a huge interest of mine. My mom's a great cook- especiallyfufu and palm nut soap. I think I have got it from her. From my point of view, having learned how to cook, makes a persons life much easier.Upon completion, the government of Ghana bans recruitment of employees. Hence, I have established printing press at home, where I go to schools to seek for examinations questions to type, print and submit them at the rate of 10 copies for $1.  I manage to get about $110 per month as profit. I incurred production cost of about $200.  I am able to help private schools in my area, Weija, which do not have the requisite means to type and print their examination questions themselves. Infant private schools do face the challenge of established printing press where the teacher can present their examination and other test for them to be typed and printed for the students to answer. Upon realizing the need and been jobless at home I thought to do something to remedy the challenge. I later realized that I can learn Microsoft Office and typing to render service to these institutions that are in need. I have learned the said skills, I deploy them to assist schools by typing and printing their examinations for them.  I used the revenue I generate to provide food for my old parent and the rest for my livelihood expenditure. Starting business in Ghana is not easy. The increment in utilities- water bills, electricity bills, rent, and taxes. What has recently retrogressed business is the frequent power outages. I hope to get fuel generator to power but since I do not have the requisite fund I am rely on Ghana Electricity Company. I hope to see expansion of my business so that I will start a family -wife and children. I hope to use my profit to expand the business so that I will be able to employ more people in the company. This will aid my colleagues who are troubled, seeking job and not getting one. I hope to help improve the life of others by aiding them to get their livelihood.Please I need loan to buy printer to expand my business. Unfortunately the printer I am using has broken down and I have to buy new one which is about 200 Dollars. Now I am not able to work because the printer is spoiled.

Being a village setting in the heart of the present Nyandarua County, both had forfeited their jobs for various reasons and poverty was threatening the union from the very beginning. I must say they endured, often having to beg to go to maize fields where established farmers had harvested their maize crop to just pick any available leftovers. They worked hard through the next few years and with the size of the family having grown to five in just four years, they were already doing considerably well and had no problems raising us through the next decade.Then came my secondary school education! This would be the next big shock for the family. A combination of factors saw everything we had amassed through the years evaporate into thin air and within three years of learning, everything came to a standstill. By now my family had grown to seven members. It took the intervention of some other individuals (so grateful to these people) to restart where everything was held for couple years. I worked hard knowing it was really rare to get such an opportunity, and finally qualified to take a course at the university. It was tough getting through this again - no money, little to spend, sometimes wondering whether anything will ever work out, but am finally getting to pursue my biggest dream - leading an entrepreneurial life where I can accord many more who could be going through my base steps an easier route to their future.I am an entrepreneur making the first steps of the long journey I wish to pursue. Currently I'm much into freelance work, but will be transitioning into both the production and service sectors in the nearest future. Freelance work has opened many opportunities for me, and with the right funding and partners I believe every other great dream is rightly within reach.I spend much of my free time interrogating news, seeking the most probable leads to why issues are reported the way they do, and questioning figures for correctness and accuracy. I love football, and also spends time watching other sports, majorly athletics. I am conscious of my body-weight and takes every available opportunity to sneak for a walk, run, or a football game.I am (as indicated above) a freelance worker, with a tremendous inclination into writing and research. It is such an important field and meeting clients' demands is not only tricky but also tedious. But my passion for it is unmatched. I have developed quite a lot in my understanding of this type of work, and wish to better equip myself to achieve even more. Besides this, I'm greatly interested in the service industry, software development and manufacturing. I'm responsible for the educational needs of my two youngest siblings, who are currently transitioning through their secondary school education, one of the most difficult phases my family ever endured to raise me through to who I am. I greatly appreciate anyone who takes their moment to relate to my life story. Without doubt, someone has endured as much, some even more, but that doesn't make our today any better without that listening ear. Thank you!I am humbled to be communicating with you on my intentions ton purchase a new laptop for my freelance work. Apparently, my current machine does not have the minimum capacity to handle the complex software I often need to complete sophisticated assignments from my clients. More so, some of the basic tools in my trade are advanced data analysis software that are not available freely and some need quite a bit of monetary input. The good thing is, projects involving such software as Matlab and STATA pay quite highly and this's where I target to hit! Below is a simple breakdown of what I aim to achieve in the long run, bearing in mind that the amount initially available to me may not essentially cover the entire list of items hereon.Laptop - $500Matlab - $400STATA - $250Office Chair - $200My listing for the software includes rough estimates of each since joining hands with other already interested freelancers will mean we acquire a multi-user version at much lower price than the one-user policy. I believe with your loan will help me to gradually acquire these items. I expect to be able to earn an extra $300 per month once these tools and equipment are in place. I can henceforth select more profitable projects and cater better for my expenses and grow my business to new heights such that it can create extra employment for other people. Besides, my little sister and brother will not have to endure the pain I endured to complete their studies.Thank you for your time and enthusiasm to help me through this project. I will be equally committed to reimburse both on time and as proposed.Warm regards,Edwin",0.87862191924558042,0.60601190325147147,1

I started my basic education at the Jema L/A (now D/A) Basic school and completed in the year 2001 with aggregate 6 in Basic Education Certificate Examination. Since I lost my father in Primary 4, financing my education was a difficulty for my ailing mother. Through the support of my present family (foster family-God richly bless them), I made it to the Senior High School (Kintampo Secondary School) where i passed in the year 2004. Overcoming hardships has been a miracle. God sent my present family to help me through. Now Although I have a employment as a health worker, I wish to help others who are passing through the same situation I went through. My passion for farming has earned me a small cocoa farm that has employed one person.I have a small cocoa farm for which I have employed people to cater for it. This is about a half acre plot of cocoa. The yield from the cocoa is not encouraging due to inadequate funds to purchase inputs and chemicals  to help boost the yield. This problem  was solved with my previous loan. Thanks to my lenders. However, I always hire spraying machine which also affects my ability to pay my worker. For this reason, I am unable to pay my employee well and this is affecting his output on the farm. Ghana is one of the major exporters of cocoa in the sub-saharan Africa. Currently the production is going down due to poor yield. Therefore, if people like us are able to purchase inputs and chemicals to spray our farms, it would boost the production of cocoa in the country and the economy of the country would also be improved. The proceeds from the sales of my cocoa would be used to pay the school fees of my nephews and also to purchase food for my mother. I would also use some to purchase more inputs for the next seasons activities. But this loan is needed to purchase Cocoa spraying machineThis loan would be used to purchase purchase chemicals like Confidor, cocoa fertilizers and protective gear for my employee. This will help boost my yield from about two and half bags per season to about 5 bags. This will help me pay my employee and also be able to pay for my nephews school fees.",0.39401042173048734,0.3635595297559337,1

I come from a family of six, my parents inclusive. I live at New Weija a suburb of the Accra Metropolis. I am a student and I am currently at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology pursuing a degree course in Civil Engineering.I started a marketing business in order to lift some burden off my parents. I market products such as popcorn machines,hand-made crafted bead bags and purses, wooden bags and more online. The money I gain from the sale of these items are used to pay my school fees and my feeding. I also sometimes re-invest the money into other lucrative businesses to get my returns. As a young gentleman, I want to come out of the University prepared to affect my generation positively. I want to do this by training my fellow young ones the skills and appropriate way to marketing especially in Ghana and Africa- this will mean I should have a hands-on training in that regard. With the help of Zidisha and lenders I will promote my marketing plans.I love to play table tennis, video games as well as football. At my free time I love to read my bible, search for more website where I can post my adverts and market more items online.The business I do is online marketing of products. I mostly market products such as teaching aids to people online, door-to-door, through posters and advertisement. My Dad is a handicraft producer who mainly produces teaching aids in both wooden and digital forms. These teachings aids are a supplement to help teachers guide children in their formative stages. The teaching aids would help build their fundamental study of pronouncing words and how to communicate. There is a demand for these goods and services because  there are a lot of schools encompassing my neighbourhood and these different schools need these teaching aids to help boost their level of communication to children. My business is much preferred because the teaching aids are sharp,real,easy to read and understand,quality,durable and very attractive and most of all very reasonable(in terms of cost). The business is profitable because there isn't much of a competiton and therefore we are able to supply to a large number of schools in the neighbourhood and make our profits. The main risks my business faces is that, should there be an error in the wording(digital form of teaching aids), it could be rejected and the cost of production is lost. However, this risk isn't so much of a problem because we have alternatives to remedy the situation whenever it occurs. I mostly make approximately 95usd every month. I believe through advertisement I can take over a greater number of schools in my country.In this next credit limit, I intend to use the loan to start up the delivery of pineapple fruit juice. This is a venture i intend to start to supplement the income I already receive from my sale of popcorn machines. I intend to buy 100boxes of pineapple fruit juice which would amount to a total of $631. In each box of fruit juice contains 24bottles. We intend to sell the 100 boxes at a sum total of $816,hence a profit margin of $203  would be made. The money would be regenerated and hence could be used to order for more of the pineapple juice and then used to satisfy the demands of the market. This means a non- ending generation of profit once there is a demand to supply on the market.This profit margin would help me to defray my university fees and as well as my lecture materials. It would also go along way to help my expenses as a student.This business soughts to provide easy snacks and deserts to students on and off campus.

I moved to kakamega because my mother was not in a position to pay for my school fees and at that time my parents had separated.  My mother later on passed. After primary I joined Ingotse high school were I completed my O'level. I later joined Nibs college which I dint complete for lack of fees. I started working as a turn boy loading building materials on the lories. In 2009 I decided to go back to western n start a small business. I bought compact disks(movies) at a wholesale price of sh  20/= each which I sold at a retail of  sh 50/= each. I did that for almost one year but due to the county council demanding for permits I had to drop the business. A friend of mine offered me a job to be his  conductor . Ald look for clients to board taxi and at the end of the day earn something for my stomach and some small savings. After two years I was able to get my first loan from one  financial institutions  and was able to partner with one of my friends to buy one  second hand car which we used as a taxi. I could work during the day as he worked at night. By then I had gone for driving school and qualified. After sometime we sold the car and shared the money equally.  I was able to buy my own though not on cash but I always worked hard to pay the difference. I am now married with one kid my wife was working on her boutique but due to expansion of the roads the stalls were demolished. Still looking for somewhere to put up the business.I do car hire and taxi services here in Kakamega town. Initially I operated a small boutique which my wife was running but due to expansion of the roads the stalls were demolished but I was lucky to get another space were I have set up a motorcycle spare parts shop. With the little savings I have set from my other business which Zidisha  has  been my pivot  the business is doing great.  I chose this business because most people in this town use motorbikes as a means of transport because its cheap and convenient and thats were my spare business comes in. In this town we have over ten thousand motorbikes and i can tell we have not more than ten shops though we have three big ones which the owners import the spares directly from china were we small retailers we go and buy from them. (Looking forward to that too) From the profit I make am able to restock my shop as well as pay school fees for my loving daughter. From my shop am able to make upto 70% profit everymonth.At the same time I also get around ksh 70000 from my taxi business from which am able to pay for the monthly instalments for my car and the other twenty thousand I add stock to my shop and do small savings. Thank you all.Thank you Zidisha for this golden chance. With the ksh 59564, I will be able to do a major shopping for my shop which has not been doing that well the past months. First am going to get a number of tyres. One tyre goes at a wholesale price of 8 dollars from my shopping list av listed 20 tyres which will cost 160 dollars. I have also listed engine blocks at least 10 of them for different bikes, three for each bike one goes at 20 dollars that means I will need 200 dollars for the engine blocks. My stock also lacks Tvs and Bajaj dashboards which goes for 8 dollars each. For ten peaces five each I will be required to have 80 dollars. The other items I need are headlights, indicators, side mirrors, piston kits, Piston rings, connecting rod and tubes from all that I have done a rough calculation it comes to a total of 200 dollars and my shop will be complete again and be able to serve my clients well again and be in the competition. The challenge here is when a client comes to my shop and he or she doesn't find wat they need next time they won't come to ask they assume you dont have everything they need. Thank You again for being their for me and may God keep you all to continue giving support to may other young and old entrepreneurs like me to meet their daily needs.

For bedspreads size 3 (120x200) with the details of the purchase price of 57,000, - the selling price of cash 65,000 (profit 14:03%), - the price of jualtempo 70,000 (profit 22.80%), - the selling price if paid 2 months = 80,000 (profit 40.35%), bedcover with details - purchase price = 275,000, 300,000 cash selling price (profit 9:09%), -the tempo selling 325,000 (profit 18:00%), - the selling price if the 2 month to pay 360,000 (30% gain). So it depends on the buyer to select which payment. In addition I use this loan money for stocking clothes for Eid because certainly a lot of people who need clothes for Eid usually I take advantage of 20% of the purchase price but I was selling cash. Zidisha please help me, thank you in advance and I promise to pay on time.",0.7687508438373698,0.44390137786602202,1

I am a teacher by profession and teach in Menji Agric senior high school in the Tain district in Ghana. My knowledge in Agriculture during my senior high school, coupled with my passion for farming has enabled me  to engage in cashew farming.Proceeds from my farm will enable me to help take care of my family of four and other three dependants( cousin and nephew) who are schooling.I periodically offer assistance to brilliant but needy and orphan kids in both my community and the school I teach. My ambition is to become a renowned cashew farmer in future.My hobbies are reading story books, watching football and listening to music.I have a three hectare cashew farm which was started two years ago. My crops have started fruiting and I hope to start harvesting by next year. I employ casual labour to help with the management of my farm.I also deal in buying and selling of cashew nuts and shea nuts.  Brong Ahafo region of Ghana has been blessed with cashew which serves as the main cash crop in the region.I purchase cashew nuts from farmers in the nearby communities and convey to cashew buying centers (mostly in towns) for sale.  Most of the farmers are unable to convey their nuts to towns for sale.My plan is to expand my  cashew retail into wholesale in future and employ extra hands. I will also process the cashew fruits into fruit juice in the near future since emphasis is placed on the nuts, leaving the fruits to get rotten.I come from the northern part of Ghana which is blessed with shea nuts. Shea butter is extracted from the shea nuts for consumption and export. Most of the indigenous people have difficulty in selling the shea nuts so I move around the region and buy from the rural folks and sell to the shea butter companies in the cities.I have a  cashew farm which was well catered for through the assistance that I received from Zidisha a couple of months ago.  Part of the loan I will secure would be used in paying for laborers to weed my cashew farm. The cashew season is over but the Shea nuts season is fast approaching. I intend channelling the remaining amount to the buying and selling of Shea nuts in the northern region of Ghana.I will use $50 for the wedding of my farm,$200 for the purchase of Shea nuts for resale. I will use part of my monthly salary for the purchase of sacks,transportation and other miscellaneous expenses.I hope that my loan would be funded to realize my dreams in life and give back to the society through supporting needy kids in my community.",0.5441948513641186,0.86840083063301265,1

I was promoted from there to become a branch manager which helps me achieve more social status in my area for over 2 years. I then further my education to the Polytechnic to be trained as an electrical engineer and I came out as an expert in electrical engineer. I render my services to a whole lot of institution to help them fix their electrical problems and also organize seminars to give out tutorials to help train people on fire out break issues because I have the heart to do that. I Love to help the needy by ensuring they come out with their problems and help  by giving out advice and material things if I can. For all these years I have been dreaming of becoming a minister of God to evangelize to people and so my decision to become an Evangelist began on the year 2009 where I started going to BibleTheology School. During my period of studies I took office in some managerial positions to enhance myself well on the field of studies to get most of the benefit of me staying in the school. I had a couple of good remarks when I go out from school to do industrial attachment that was instructed by the school management from my mentors. I graduated on the year 2011 and started pastoring at a branch church which I have been commissioned to take fully charge of the church to see to it spiritual growth and also effective administration system to help the church to expand and touch the lives of people as many as it can to preach the Gospel of Christ Jesus.MY BUSINESSAs I said earlier I am a pastor in a church and I run fully control of the church spiritually and its physical administration. The church has helped many people in the community inwardly within the community and also outside. Evangelism trips are organized where the youth are actively involved to pass the pastoral ministerial appointment to them to posses  the  need skills to care and lead the people in the near future to ensure the continuous existence of the church into an unforeseeable future to still carry it objectives as a church. The church wish to expand to the international level to get international recognition to lift the image of the church high to touch as many as it can lives of people as already said which is possible by internationalization. The church lacks the requisite funds to achieve it stated objectives as church and even performing it social obligations to the community to establish schools and other facilities for the community. Inwardly within the church, certain equipment are needed to be bought  which includes chairs, microphone, tables and many other things to help the church get its immediate stand to pull out people into the church to worship the supreme God. Lack of these materials in the church is what is dumping the progress of the church for now which I found it very challenging when I assume office and am doing my possible best to meet all these requirement.The church getting access to a financial money lending company like zidisha.org  and its decisions to help people will help the church meet it well stated objectives to preach the gospel globally to the people which I believeI need to raise an amount of GHS800 to buy microphones and a speakers to go out and preach the gospel of Christ to nearby villages. Please help me out in anyway you can to help win souls for Jesus. I promise to repay on time and to also abide by zidisha.org community terms.

I was born on the 14th of October, 1986. I belong to a family of five with two siblings. I started my education at Freeman Methodist Preparatory School at Berekum. I had my Junior High education at St. Marys Junior High School and proceed to Sunyani Senior High for my High school education.I hold a Bsc. Chemistry degree from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. I was posted to Duayaw Nkwanta, a small town in Brong Ahafo Region to do my National Service in 2009 at Serwaa Kesse Girls Senior High School. At the time the school was unknown and had a small population mostly from the villages around Duayaw Nkwanta. I sort to find a way of helping raise the image of the school, so I started a Debating club in the school. I faced a lot of challenges with all sorts of false allegations levelled against me, most especially because I was a science teacher handling debate. But I never gave up knowing I wasnt doing it for myself but for the students involved and the exposure they were getting. In our first year of participating in the National Debating competition for Senior High Schools in 2011, we won the District competition and came second in the Zonals. This boosted our moral and we started preparing for the 2012 edition immediately. During the 2012 edition we won all competitions all the way to the finals where we met and beat one of the best schools in Ghana, St. Peters SHS to become National champions. Since then the school has become one of the best schools in Ghana with girls coming from all over the country. My debate team continues to do well having won all district and zonal competitions since 2012 and placed second twice at the regional level. It was during my interaction with students in my team I realized most of them had serious financial problems so I started to support them with the allowances I made. I sometimes get friend to assist. Not very long ago a Peace Corps volunteer in my school and I successfully raise two school terms fee for one of such students through Facebook. I am not able to bear the sight of a brilliant student in need.It is in view of this that I started to do business with the aim of raising enough money so I could continually support such students. I am still teaching Chemistry in the school.In an attempt to find a short term income earning business because of the purpose of supporting students, my attention was drawn to how beautiful shirts sewn with Ghanaian print and designs were fashionable and people loved today. I also realized that though very beautiful it wasnt very expensive and is very easy to wear and appear at all functions. The problem with most people was that tailors usually disappointed people with it came to time of delivery therefore killing the interest of many.I decided to buy the prints and give tailors various designs to sew them into, I would then sell them already made to people. So I send the shirts in various shapes, sizes and designs to other schools and offices. It cost $10 to buy materials and sew one shirt. I sell a shirt at $15. I am able to sell an average of 50 shirts a month.I however do not have a shop in which I sell so all the shirts are kept in my house. So i only sell when i move to the customers. I also do not have my own means of transport so i rely on public transport which takes a lot of time.My plan is to raise enough money to hire a shop to expand the business and. Also to buy a motorbike to make movement faster and cheaper so I can maximize profitIt is my hope that Zidisha would help me acquire the loan to help to build upon my business since the interest rates and conditions attached to the banks and other financial institutions are unbearable.I am certain of keeping my payment on schedule because i have a permanent source of income as a salary worker. I promise I wont disappoint. And by helping me you will be helping the students in my school who have need for money. Thank youA friend in the USA who visited me recently has requested that I ship some of the shirts to him to that business can begin there since African prints are in high demand in the USA. In other to achieve new sets of designs will have to be introduced especially ones that depicts African culture. It will cost $20 to produce and ship one shirt which will sell in the USA  for a minimum of $50. So s net profit of $30 will me made which will help me continue to support my less privileged students",0.0,0.80002657331656013,1

I came about this business when I realized the need for access ito the interior of my home place during odd hours or places where the conventional public means cannot reach. my favorite hobby is to watch movies and listen to music.My main source of income is from my employment at Fuelsave Technologies ltd. my motorbike business where I've now employed two riders to do it for me offers a transport solution to interior places of the place I live. The typical cost involved in this business are the fueling and  servicing charges of the motorbike as well as paying my riders on a daily basis. the profit I get from this business I use it for buying of food in my house as well as payment of rent. in due time I hope to have about five bikes and a public service vehicle to increase my  daily/monthly  income.I am mainly motivated by the fact  that despite  increasing my income I am able to provide employment to atleast two people now in a country where youth unemployment is at a high rate.Over the last few  months the need for motorbike service has increased tremendously and as such I see a potential for more business if I obtained another bike making it my 3rd.  Topping up with my savings of $850 that I have in the bank I shall require an extra $100 to fully reach the current retail price of a motorbike  of 130cc that currently stands at $ 940 .  With this new motorbike I shall be able to employ a third person to my business.On purchase this motorbike has the potential to yield in a return of $ 4 on a daily basis after my rider has been paid his daily wages and daily fueling of the  motorbike has been done. On average this $ 4  that I make in profits in a day may not be much  but with three bikes I can be able to raise $12 which I  plan to put in a college fund to enable me get my degree in telecomunications engineering.

It mainly carries passengers from the bus termini to other destinations within the town.I chose this kind of business because I realized that in Mombasa town, some places are not easily accessible by Matatus, i.e. public service vehicles and as such people have to walk long distances to reach their destinations. With tuktuk you can access most areas in town especially where streets are narrow. At the same time I realized that the returns from this business are not that bad.I make at least 450 US dollars per month. I use at least 300 US dollars to cater for fuel, driver and maintenance costs.I use my profits to reinvest and part of it I do save so that I can be able to add another Tuktuk vehicle.To overhaul my tuktuk vehicle which have not been serviced for some time now.

Iam a Kenyan by birth. Currently i live in Nakuru County, WEAVERS area near  my local chiefs camps plot block 4/25 door no5. this is where i have rented a house which i stay with my wife Beth Wanjiru and my child.  I attended my primary school at Kibowen Komen  and successively i finished the approved course for class eight.  I Passed very  well and i joined well renowned high school known as Flamingo high school. At my high school i also did well and i wanted  to  join a collegeanddo a course  in  the fieldof business  known as business administration but unfortunately my mother was not able to pay my school fees.  At  this point  there was nothing i could do to get money for my fees. I promised my self that i will face life the way it is until i better my life financially to continue with my education. ASi was thinking on what i could do to keep life moving.Some business ideas flocked my mind; very nice ideas but however nice they were, I realized they all  had a common similarity. That is the capital. this is the factor that caused me to do what i know do happily' transporting people using motor cycle from home to job and job to home, and of-course taking people around my town. I started transporting people using a bicycle for six months i managed to gather enough money for paying my motorcycle driving course which i passed obtained my driving linces. Immediately i was employed as a motorcycle taxi driver. I worked  for my boss for one year and eight months and by the grace of God i managed to save enough  to buy  one of my own motorcycle. Throughout my live i have learned to work hard and involve the almighty God in all my life goals.  When i look back on where i have come from i find a good reason to thank God  and pray to achieve all my dreams.  Just like any other person, i have had the likes and dislikes too, for instance  when i was about twelve years i used to enjoy watching movies playing brick games fighting my neighbors kids to exercise new styles learned from watching movies  and many other childish games. But as i grew older i adopted new likes and dislikes to. Ever since i discovered my self  i no-longer enjoy doing things i used to do when i was twelve except one, watching movies. I now enjoy listening to new gospel  musicand accompanying my pastor at my free time to do Evangelical work.  This year, i have started saving towards buying another motorcycle to hire out to drivers who needs it. Hiring out motorcycle tax is now a booming business in my locality. Also note am happy to have joined  zidisha family  since i have recieved  severalloans  that have truly saved my business from fear of temporally  shutting  down,eg, imagine a situation where, you have no good tires, customers not arriving due to punctures, no valid insurance, every time you are in police custody due to this, one can easily close down  temporary or permanently.ONE big reason as to why i borrow small loan from you is that, for people of small income like me, we are not able to save for emergencies since every day am solving either family problems or job problems. This feature is common since the space we have before landing to financial emergency is small, hence saving sometimes is difficult. However i am trying to save through locked account to enable me buy another motorbike so that i can hire out to qualified drivers in order to increase my income. After achieving this goal i may wish to apply loan for my education, classes are available to business people like me late in the evening.Here i write to say thank you for always funding my profile, Over ten loans from zidisha and you have always funded me on the first application sometimes thirty minutes after submitting my application, May almighty God bless you.When one arrives at Nakuru county town center, Just about two kilomita drive to the west. MY business is located at Manyatta hotel.Manyatta hotel is next to another big hotel known as PIVOT hotel. Opposite Pivot hotel is a small petrol station known as KOBIL petrol station. ON your entrance to the petro station is where i park my motorbike to wait for customers with my fellow workers who do the same business. the picture i have provided is taken right where i work.  i normally provide transportation services.that is hiring services,taking people to their residential houses when its late,there is high demand of the service i offer at my locality simply because all vehicles they normally transport up to certain limit that is at bus terminal but i curry/take my customer up to their door gates.and also they call me to pick them and transport them to their work.through this many client they market my business and sent more new customer to me. Lately i have entered into contracts of taking pupils to schools and getting payments on weekly and monthly basis.  Thank  you for choosing to be of help to me and my motorcycle tax business; God bless you.Dear my lenders, it is true that, i need more in order to keep working and working, taking good care of my only hope that is my tax motorbike is my priority. through my tax motorbike am able to, 1, pay my daily, weekly and monthly bills. above all, take care of my family, the very reason i turn to you again and again when i need more money to buy the above motorcycle tools is not because i cannot afford, but it is because honestly saving money is a problem for people of low income with many responsibility to take care of. i now know the more reason i really need you again and again. you ability to give me loan makes you special and of high value in my business, Saving my business through your loan makes me happy and wish that almighty God retains you my lenders in zidisha lending forum forever.",0.5530020752938003,0.7345562374414053,1

After staying in the hot sun for a couple of hours, i could at times end up with nothing simply because the charcoal could all bun to ashes while i am a sleep at night. 2. The forest wardens could hunt me and chase me threatening even to shoot me. 3. The prices could at times go down such that i could end up selling at a very law cost. With all this challenges i resolved to think again. I tried my luck to look for a job but due to corruption, i could not find one because i had no money to bribe. It was only when my uncle bought a p.s.v vehicle that he employed me as a conductor, he was paying me 100/- per day and 50/- for lunch. I got married and together with my intellectual wife, we saved the money going without lunch most of the times. a few month later, my uncles vehicle was auctioned  due to the fact that he bought the vehicle on loan and as a drunker, he invested the money he got in drinks forgetting that he has a loan to pay. I admired the business and dream that one day i would get one so i may make money as my uncle simply because in 0ne trip, we could net 2000 and we could go 5 to 6 trips a day. i believe i could do better than my uncle since i only drink milk. After it all, we found that we had saved 3350 and that is how we started a retail shop business. At the time of my wife's death in 2009 we had a stock of over 200,00 and 2 motorbikes. So that is how i started. I therefore hate alcohol and those taking it because 1. it made my father to forget his responsibility as the man of the house 2. It robbed me my job as a conductor.I want to expand my shop so I may serve more people therefore I want to add two more laptops and a printer.this will increase my earnings and the community around will get it more easy to get these services at door step.

I want to also want to create more jobs to the community around by employing a few more personnel.Once again iam grateful to zidisha and my lenders, iam here requesting for this loan to expand my business to a high note,I am opening another branch in a different town I employ my sister who has two kids to take care of my profits will raise to upto 60 percent because I'll now be targeting two shops.God has been faithful to me n through zidisha I've touched people's lives like where I mentioned I am paying school fees for my niece and I've employed another sister who is now able to take care of her two school going children, if I get this third loan I know profits will go high ill get my two kids an education policy.

I'm an agricultural enthusiast, with a Bachelor's Degree in Agriculture. I'm even planning to do a Master's program and my dreams are way far beyond normal reach. I've always had passion for anything to do with Agriculture ever since I was a young girl. The one thing I love most about agriculture is how it's revolutionizing with time. The machines being used today are not things we had when I was a young girl. This revolution has brought so passion and drive for even further innovation. I decided to venture into agriculture, since the first day in college. After college, I sought a job for two years without any fruits or signs of even getting one. What sustained me during this time was my husband's earnings. This was not the life I had always dreamed of, being nothing more than a house wife. I always felt I had the potential to do even much big, if only I had the opportunity.It dawned on me that I was letting my potential waste away by just staying indoors. We later came into an agreement with my husband that I'd have to go back home and invest in the tea plantations. We bought a couple acres of tea land, and this has been of much benefit to me and my family, as a whole. Tea exportation is one of Kenya's major revenue sources. It's a huge industry which has been performing quite well. It's actually one of the major boosters of Kenya's economy, as a whole. Having recognizing this, I've been constantly looking for ways to maximize on my effort and earnings. I've to say the previous year hasn't been of what I had expected. I've realized that I've been failing the recent months due to my lack of innovation. If I would implement good, suitable technology ideas, I'd be succeeding and doing even far much more. I want to buy two ploughing machines and create partitions on my land so that calculating and working efficiently will be easy. I'm also planning to increase the number of workers on the land. This will boost the amount of work done in a day, and in turn, increase my earnings.Once am granted this loan of 385 us dollars i will build a harvesting shade that will help me during harvesting, The Harvested tea will be placed under the shade so to maintain its kilograms and be fresh before they are collected and take to the factory.This shade will also help workers to have a place to rest as they take their lunch.I will budget for 300 us dollars for the shade construction and carpenters lab-our.The remain 85 us dollars will be for farm inputs at 50 us dollars and paying workers 35 us dollars.",0.64062287748803115,0.0,1

I sell popular food at an affordable price.  I also sell packaged food in take-away form (where a food is packaged and the clients eats outside the hotel as shown on my profile photo).

I was thereby forced to look for employment, which I swcured and used the income to pay for my university course (B.com - Finance). I managed to complete it and got a better job as a marketer, whereby 2 years later, the company downsized by retrenching a number of us.

In my work environment, I am driven by the resolve of people working odd jobs in an attempt to fulfill their dreams.My hobby is appreciating nature. I love growing plants and keeping animals, which I do in the village, with an aquarium in my city dwelling.My current business is a combination of entertainment and essential service provision.I sell movies, both new and classic, which I purchase from distributors for resale to clients. Demand for this was realized on seeing that people undergo a lot of stress in modern society and seek an escape such as watching an appealing movie to relieve their stress. I also charge phones at a fee. With everyone having a smartphone that is always out of charge, I found it essential to provide a secure environment to provide this service. I also provide transportation services using a small multipurpose van commonly known as Toyota probox. This seems to be my main source of income, whih has prompted me to have the vehicle be inspected by the relevant government authorities, so as to allow the ferrying of both goods and customers legally. The law requires that a vehicle used for such service provision be inspected annually. I also want to make an addition to the car, by purchasing a strong roof rack, that will assist to increase the vehicle's carrying capacity. I have lost some jobs because this van is smaller than the one I had. Depending on the available funds, I am considering starting a photocopy business, that will be an all inclusive one stop office center.My typical costs are rent, purchases for resale, staff wages, electricity bills and vehicle maintenance costs.Proceeds from the business assist to pay for my sons school fees, as well as helping friends and relatives children go to school.Dear Lenders.My plan is to have the van inspected by the relevant government authority, so as to be on the right side of the law, thereby enabling a conducive working environment, to operate without fear or harrasment. This will increase turnover and therefore profits. Projections are at an increase of roughly 30%, as we begin, and possibly higher in future.I also wish to set up a comprehensive office solutions shop. This is an idea I know will work well, as it is an essential service and also because there is only one other shop that provides these services in the area. This service will help institutions like hospitals, schools and others, plus students nd individuals who require these services efficiently and cost effectively. I intend to beat the competition by good md efficient service provision, plus adding lamination, binding, typing, printing amd even web browsing, on demand, which are all services not provided by the competition. This will therefore be a new income source.Items to be purchased / paid for are as  follows;1. Vehicle inspection (booking and sticker) -USD 1502. Photocopier machine (second hand) -USD 3003. Laminator -USD 504. Stationery stocks- USD 305. Site renovation and painting - USD 100",0.55570204449128136,0.77361970189224316,1

As an ordinary Ghanaian child, been brought up in Muslim dominated area and by Muslim parents, I grew to become a good practicing Muslim. I started my basic education in an English and Arabic basic school in my neighbourhood, where i had a good foundation in circular education as well as good moral and religious values.During my secondary education, all though innocent i became a victim of a demonstration that was staged by the student body against teachers. I was wrongfully accused of been one of the leaders of the demonstration and was therefore suspended indefinitely. Living with a poor and illiterate family, i found myself in a very hard and difficult situation. But i was very determined to achieve success in life which i know the best way to succeed in life is to be educated. But my parent could not afford to pay for my education any longer after the mess i created. I realized that i can make some money if I commercialize my hobby which is photography. Thanks to God with determination i am now a graduate.As stated earlier on, i started my own business as a photographer because i needed to raise some funds to carter for my education, praises to God i am now a professional photographer as well as a Bsc marketing holder . Also last year,  i decided to diversify in to livestock rearing and selling and the business looks promising  if i can raise enough capital.I live in Aboabo, a neighborhood within Asokore Mampong Municipal Assembly in Kumasi. A densely populated area, the people are mostly Muslims. The two major festivals that are celebrated in the area are Eid-Adha & Eid Fitr festival.I have been blessed with four children two males and two females, the first child Arimiyawu who is nine years old was named after my father, he is in class three and wants to become a doctor in future. Zaliya is the name of my second child and so far the most brilliant of them all. She wants to become a lawyer in future.My grandfather was a professional photographer and I have had a camera in my hand for as long as I can remember. When I have finished a portrait session, wedding, or an event, I not wait to get home, load the images on my computer and see what I have captured. Then I love going into Photoshop to make them even better and presenting them to the client. Its such a thrill and so gratifying when they love their images.I am into livestock business where I buy, raise and sell sheep and cows for a profit.  It is a known fact that as long as humans exist, there will always be need for food and the two major sources of food for mankind are crops and animals. This lead to an increase in the demand for meat products in this world. As well, i found it very rewarding when i started the business. One of the major reasons why the demand for sheep and cow is very high especially in my communityis that, apart from sources of food for mankind, the people of my area who are dominantly Muslims use sheep and cows for their naming ceremonies, sacrifices during Edi-Adah festivals and many other occasions like marriage celebrations, funeral celebrations e.t.c.My choice for Sheep and cow breeding and selling as a business is because, it is very lucrative and a profitable venture, more especially if you raise a good number of them but to do that needs much or high capital.  However, for an entrepreneur to succeed in such a venture, patience is required as well as understanding the cycles of your business.Costs and revenue of my Sheep and cow Production business include;1) Establishment Costs: These are those costs that are associated with the establishment of a new or transitioning operation.  Examples of establishment costs include: Purchases of livestock, fencing costs, watering system e.t.c.2) Variable Costs: These are those costs that change directly with an increase or decrease in flock size example feeding and medication.3) Fixed Costs: Fixed costs or overhead costs do not change as a result of an increase or decrease in acreage.  Examples of fixed costs include land taxes, rent and rates.With the production of sheep and cow, the revenue or return is mainly from the sale of the livestock.My intention once again is to invest this loan in to my business which has a positive potential for growth.I am already an established live stock business man. I basically buy, raise and sell sheep and cows for profit.An average size sheep will cost about GH450 and that of a cow is about GH1500. As I mentioned in my last proposal, my line of business is very lucrative and profitable especially when it comes to festive seasons.This amount GH3983 will increas my capital by 60% which will have a great significance in my business, with this increase in my capital, I projectrd to increase my earnings to about 50% to 55%.",0.74200701831332483,0.87774630915027751,1

I have grown up wanting to be an independent lady and a role model to my siblings.I started agribusiness farming 10 months ago in my home area after securing my previous loans from Zidisha. I managed to have two dairy cows and sustained my vegetable farm, where I have been getting some good harvest. Currently my farm is doing good: on the farm is a plantation of cabbages and I expect to be harvesting in early July. Having now established my vegetable farm and gotten a good market, I want to sustain the project with the earnings gotten from the farm as I venture into another income-generating project. With the three loans I have gotten on this platform, I have seen my income grow, which is being supplemented with my salary earnings as a nurse.Out of my current savings and the loan I will get here, I plan to start my own dispensing chemist [pharmacy], where I will be treating common illnesses to people within the locality. Some of these common illness are upper respiratory tract infections (since this is a tea growing zone) and malaria. I would also provide wound dressing, family planning services, immunizations and manage clinical symptoms like joint pains (especially for the elderly), headaches and abdominal discomfort.With the great name as a nurse I have earned in my community and the great confidence they have in me, I just realized that so many were taking advantage of that, having me prescribe drugs for them and sending me to the chemist in a nearby town to bring them the drugs I would prescribe to them.I have noted this to be a great opportunity, and I want now to bring these drugs closer to them and also do some baseline investigation such as blood pressure monitoring, temperature and weight before commencement of treatment.I want now to grow my passion of seeing a healthy community through managing some medical conditions and giving them health education.My sole business is to dispense drugs over the counter and see patient with clinical symptoms, on whom I can do baseline investigations before prescribing any drugs. This shall be after a charge since the clients will be required to pay some consultation fee, and this will sustain my clinic alongside the sale of drugs. Since my home is situated near a shopping center, I have acquired a room at a cost of $70 US dollars, this being a remote area. I plan to renovate the room at a cost of around $150 US dollars, since shelves will be fixed and the cost of material and labour inclusive. For a start, I require at least two digital thermometers, a weighing scale, and one blood pressure machine at a cost of around $150 US dollars, and I hope to use them for a long period without breakdown. The other things are stationery materials, pharmaceutical drugs, materials for dressing wounds, and gloves, which will cost me approximately $700 US dollars.I do not want to purchase a lot of utilities for now because of the financial strain which I might encounter, but I believe, with the amount which I will raise in Zidisha, coupled with my savings, I can roll the stone. In the future, I want to expand the business so as to be supplied from the main source.i will use the loan to upgrade my small vegetable farm and my dairy farm. the proceeds are quite good though it requires some one to work extra hard and being a lady that's a challenge but i want to overcome it. i trust zidisha team to help me realize my dream and i know that iam going to be successful in this venture later i want to advance to green house farming and utilize the dry un used lands in our area.",0.0,0.66515376135164195,1

My friends used to called me Kofi the strong man tack him and see.  They were afraid to tack me because I was strong. I grew up cultivating the habit of going to Church everyday as a Catholic for Daily Mass. As an Altar Boy or a Mass Servant I used to be at Church at 6:00 AM to prepare the Altar for Daily Mass (Church Service) at 6:30 AM. I couldnt have a better day without going for Daily Mass.As a student, I used to get myself ready for Daily Mass after which I go to school without going home. I play a good leadership role both in School and in Church. In school (Junior High), though I was not given leadership position, yet I played the role as a Senior Student. I used to go to school early to take roll call so that later comes will be penalized.  One challenge I had when in Junior High, was when my father demand that we should go to farmer and help during school hours. Even though, I was hard working as a child but to go to farmer on the expense of my school hours was serious challenge to me. However, for my hard work and better performance in school, my Headmaster help me out of this by talking to father to always allow me to benefit from my school hours rather than to the father. This made me never to forget my Headmaster. It was all because of my conduct and good behavior in school and safe me. This helps me to come out from school with a better grade. I would have perform poorly and drop out of school because of this challenge. I stared my own business as a photographer after I had some experience working with a number of sole proprietors. It has being my dream to have my own business, but how to start was a big challenge to me.Fortunately, one day I got a small camera which belongs to my brothers. I said to myself I can make business out of this, and luckily it was during Easter, thus a season for photographers to make more business. So it was the right time for me. Even though I had negative thoughts about how friends will under minds me taking up this business yet I discovered it to be lucrative business.And there I found myself in photographic. Story.I started my business in 2004 as a photographer. I got to discovered myself from my Entrepreneurship lectures as one among others who put the ideas of entrepreneurship into action. Why because I was taught by my Lecture that entrepreneurs start their own business basically with an idea and not necessarily with money. As a photographer, I started my business with no capital. I just got a small camera from my brother was determining to make business out of it. Even though, I offered Diploma in Business Studies (Accounting Option) in Kumasi Polytechnic. After my completion of the course my mind was to search for job but not to do my own business because I was taught that to do any business one need to have a start -up capital.  And I didnt have any start-up capital, so having interest in doing my own business was a big challenge. However, in the process of searching for job and working with a number of sole proprietors and private companies the idea of starting my own business was ringing loud into my hears. And this idea came into fruitful when I got that small camera from my brother. It was Easter period and as a Church member I believe it was the right time to start my photographic business. I had a lot of challenges as to how to start since I never did photographic as a course. And they were about five experience photographers already in my church not to talk about those in that community. I also had in mind that negative taught as to how people will as Polytechnic graduate becoming a photographer. But having done my costs and benefits analyses on the business there was nothing that could hold me from going in.I kick into the business and within one year I became I professional photographer and the first among the five experience photographers to introduce digital photos and with instant printer. In 2007, my uncle conceives me to join the banking industry to work as a Cashier but that couldnt stop me from the photo business. I was making more money and having more freedom in my business than working in the bank. I had to resign from the bank in 2012, because I wanted my freedom so badly than working in the bank for prestige.  Moreover, this allow me toconcentrate on my business and build it for the future. I choose this business not only because it's lucrative but I love doing it and allow me to meet new people and get connected with them for life. I also give the opportunity to travel to other places.The typical costs of printing 500 pictures currently is equal to GHS375 and all things being equal the typical revenue on this will give my business GHS 1250. I use the profit for growing my business, home improvement, and investing into other new business. I have invested some of my profit into Agency Banking which is about to kick off.I am applying for this loan to help me top up the money I have from my business to buy a new HP photo printer. The cost of the printer is currently $280. I will be paying back this loan in a monthly installment of GHS52.8 out of my business.My photography business is really doing well  since I had my 5x7 HP printer through my previous loan. It help me to produce instant pictures to my customers. This have actually increase my profit over 100%.  I am really glad with this performance in my photography as compared to when was operating without the instant photo printer. However, there is competition day in and day out and must actually meet the demand of customers to remain business. This calls for the need to have an A3 instant printer (enpson). Because most customers recently are demanding for this A3 size photos which we design beautifully to attract their attention. Having this A3 printer  in addition will go a long to help me remain in the competitive market. Customer visit my shop daily requesting for such pictures. And will be happy to meet their demand as soon as possible. It will also increase my profit margin of 50%-70%.The cost of this printer is about $625(Epson printer)",0.28758372127979381,0.20578672368820575,1

Become a hawker,By the year 1995 had not seen a computer leave alone using it, however I learnt computer skills when I was learning online Bible course in 2005 this is after the introduction of cyber services in all Kenyan postage offices. Thanks to this programme that lasted few years. From when I was born I financially struggled all through out my lifetime up 2008 when I got a grant from a friend.I decided to do computer cyber and photocopies business. From there my life changed from seeking for food only to businesses towards developments.I went back to part time classes to complete my high education. By now I have several academic papers, at present I am looking forward to join part-time course to further my education , hoping to be a part time secondary school teacher. I was displaced from Mpeketoni due to Al Shabaab attacks in the year 2014. My businesses shock.I am now resettled with my family and building up my business again. I pastor a church in the interior village . In the new lands where people are yet to be financially stable due to wild animals destroying their crops and poor environments. personally I have been an adult education teacher for three years after the same programme made me complete my high school education .My children are so ambitious some want to be armed forces others teachers and not forgetting the pilot.My businesses deals with Photos  - taking and processing  digital photos from cameramen,passport size photos, photocopies documents,typesetting laminating, ,internet. Due to a big number of  churches,schools and young people need of photos I get people or customers to serve. I was among the first people to learn computers education here and in the process I realized very few people are aware  about computers and paper services. The cost of working material is cheap and for the reason that I service my computers alone I have an added advantage.I use the income to further my education and that of my children's, I will be effectively be able to take care of my elderly mum which is a responsibility entrusted to me by my late dad who left in the year 2012 .I still expand my business by establishing new same business branches in other towns where there is potential for development. I buy land to build my permanent home in near future.I am a curious person full of ambitions.I have been constructing an iron sheet wall construction which which will finally cost 80,000. I have already built the best part of it which costed Ksh 50,000 after which I stopped due to lack of money. What remains is the roofing,painting and the floor. This building will cost me 4000 less per month than what a rented building could cost. I am planning to extend my computer services businesses to that corner of the town. In this place hope after five months time it will increase my net income by 15000 per month and put me in a position that I will be able to employ one more person who will earn her living there.

I was born on 23rd march 1990 in a family of five. I  started my primary education when I was 6 years  at kithamburu primary School where i completed my primary education in 2006.i  joined kaaga high school for secondary education and completed my Kenya Secondary Certificate Education  in 2010.As a young person from a poor background, the main hardship i have encountered after completing high school is  raising of capital to venture into agribusiness  since after completion of my secondary education, my parents were not able to finance my education to university despite the fact that I had performed  well in my secondary school examinations . I could not  sleep and hope for things to work out by themselves neither could I be hopeless and complain about everything I was going through since I knew that moment would define the direction my life would take, i.e, be better or worse.I started rearing  chicken but due to high cost it was not successful  because I had insufficient capital to invest in the project. I was introduced corn growing by a close friend .  I did my research and found out that corn business was a good area to venture in bearing in mind that the climate was favorable.  I needed a capital  outlay of 49500 ks that includes the cost of buying hybrid seeds and fertilizer.I had to adopt and implement the idea since i needed money to support my self,  look after my younger  siblings since my  parents are unable to do so since they don't have a source of income but are  peasants and at times getting daily bread for the family was a great challenge. Apart from other basic needs, my siblings needed school fess which would be readily acquired if i had some income generating project  . I sold the chicken to get capital needed to start my corn business. Through the previous loans, I have been able to expand my corn business through purchase of hybrid seeds and fertilizer and foliar and expand the production .The business has developed into a very promising  agribusiness venture  which i intend to expand more and more  after acquiring the next loan by increasing the production and ensure that 100% of the farm is under use. My home place has a cool and wet climate which promotes corn farming. I want my  siblings and children to get quality education and have all the resources to see them succeed in life and at no particular time be faced by the challenge I went through at my young age. Also, I would like to assist and support needy children in my area to enable them get a good education which may help the develop entrepreneurial skills as well as get good jobs and get them out of the chains of povertysince its the only thing that can take them out of poverty. I would also like to mentor the youth in my area to venture into agribusiness.  In my past time i like reading books on business including agribusiness,business and entrepreneurship articles.I also now engage in farming trainings at Kenya research institute which is a few meters from my home and they offer the training free of charge. The skills I have acquired from these forums has also helped me significantly.About one year  ago I decided to commercialize the project so as to generate sustenance and savings for my education and I can say the project is doing well. I was also given an extra piece of land by my grand father which was a huge boost to my business. I channeled  resources I had  to piping water to the land. Through this , I have been able to increase the output increasing the demand for corn and  clients are knocking everyday  in search of the crop. At times, I fail to match the demand since in my area, there are few people who have ventured into corn farming whereas the demand for the same is very very high.  Each month I spent around 5200  ksh on fertilizer and manure which will icrease as a result of the extra piece of land I was given by my grad father. In turn I would generate a revenue of at least 15000 ksh per season from sales of dry corn and fodder for animals. From the extra piece of land, I hope to increase the revenues to atleast KSH. 25000.All the money generated from the corn and fodder sales apart from adding on the capacity grown and improving my livelihood,  I also use the  income to cater for the education needs of my siblings and also support my elderly parents.  I save in a three year fixed account from which I plan to join collegewithin the next six months and use the savings from the corn business to finance my university  education  and pursue a course in business management and expand my business and entrepreneurial  skills.I intent to use the applied loan for the following purposes.169USD - Purchase of hybrid seeds which will be sufficient from the whole piece of land. This will lead to increased out put from the piece of land and help me enjoy economies of scale.100USD -  Will be used to purchase fertilizer for the corn which will be applied during panting, three weeks after planting and also for top dressing which will be done  weeks after  planting.65 USD  -  This will be used to purchase foliar which will be sprayed to the crop from 6 weeks after planting. This helps in improving the quality and quantity of the crop. 50USD-  This will be use to purchase a Napp sack Sprayer which will be used to spray the foliar to the crop. This will be of great help to my business since I hire the sprayer from my neighbor at 5USD every time I want to spray to my crops. Buying the sprayer will help me save on these costs permanently.",0.69010115554148432,0.82329823960489668,1

I was brought up in a humble background in a remote village in Ndia Constituency in Kirinyaga County. As the last born in a family of ten, I was fortunate to have elder brothers and sisters who supported me in my education. Nevertheless, I was not lucky enough to enjoy the warmth and soothing words of my mother who died of hypertensive stroke when I was only three years old. I attended a local primary school where I studied for 9 years.

Six years later, I joined Kenyatta University where I pursued a Bsc. degree in Biotechnology for four years. After graduating  in Dec 2010, my expectations and hopes of securing a good job were high. Moreover, people at my place always have a lot of hope in the few individuals who are lucky to acquire university education. After looking for a job for four months without success, I consulted my friends who offered to train me as a freelance writer. Since I did not have a personal computer, I had to learn typing and writing research papers in the cyber. At first, it was challenging because of my slow typing speed and lack of money to settle my bills. After one year of hard work, I managed to buy my own laptop which made my work much easier and convenient. In the meantime, my relatives and friends at home were constantly asking me whether I got a well-paying job.  I felt bad to disappoint them when I told them that I was still hustling for one. Once I became proficient as freelance writer, I decided to save some money with the aim of starting a small business. Given that freelance writing is a seasonal job, I saw it prudent to invest $940 of my savings in a retail shop. Before I managed to save this money, I had struggled with the problem of unwise spending of my money. After realizing that I needed help to overcome this problem, I took the initiative to attend various seminars where I gained useful tips on how to inculcate a culture of saving. With the help of my niece, the business has picked up well. When I am not in my shop, I am writing research papers while my niece operates the business. Moreover, the business is young and therefore requires more investment so that it can reach a stage where it can sustain itself. As such, a certain percentage of the money that I earn from freelance writing is channeled towards expanding the range of products available in my shop. Before making the decision to invest my hard-earned savings in the shop business, I took time to locate the best location that had the potential for doing the business. With the help of my brother who have many years of experience in business, I was able to locate a good place in Kayole Nairobi. My hope is to grow the business gradually with the goal of having my own supermarket. My hobbies include playing guitar, swimming, writing academic papers, and posting comments on social media.My business is a retail shop that deals with selling food items such as rice, maize flour, wheat flour, sugar, cooking oil, baked products such as cakes and bread, milk, eggs, and juices.  Recently, I have added hair gels and lotions to the stock. The shop is located in the outskirts of Nairobi City in a town called Kayole. I started the business about one year ago with a capital of $940. The shop serves a fairly large number of customers since it is strategically located at a junction along a busy street with many residents and passersby. The goods that I sell at my shop have a high demand since the area is residential with many low and middle income earners who need to do frequent shopping of food items to feed their families. The name of my business is ""Nafuu Budget Shop."" The reason I chose this name is because I wanted to catch the attention of potential customers in an area where some shop owners have even posted the prices of their items on the windows of their shops just to enable customers compare prices. The term ""Nafuu"" means better. As such, customers have been flocking at my shop, curious of doing their shopping at better prices. Moreover, the area is dominated by middle and low income earners who are often keen to compare prices before they make their purchasing decisions.  My typical costs include the cost of buying stock to re-stock the shop and also introduce new items. On a weekly basis, approximately $300 may be spent on stock and transport of the goods from the wholesalers' premises to the shop. In terms of revenue, the business generates about $550 every month. Out of this, the net profit is about $330. Part of the profit is used to pay for the rented space while some is used to pay the salary of my assistant. Nevertheless, the largest percentage of the profit is reinvested into the business to expand the range of products available as per customers' demands.If my loan proposal gets fully funded, I intend to invest the whole amount of $554 into a transportation project. A motorbike for my business will make a significant difference in my retail shop business because I will be able to penetrate into areas where products are sold at very low prices. Currently, I depend on the services of the nearest wholesalers who supply products at prices that make it impossible to compete with bigger shops. Since my competitors have enough capital to order large stocks, they are able to compete on a higher level by offering cheaper prices. In order to attract more customers and retain my loyal customers, the motorbike project will facilitate access to wholesalers who sell  commodities almost 10% lower.While a 50 kilos bag of sugar is being sold at $44 by the nearest wholesaler, I will be able to get it at $40 from markets further from my business. The same case applies to all other commodities. The cost implication in terms of fuel will be insignificant because I will no longer rely on wholesaler's transport services. The motorbike will also be ferrying passengers when it is not being used for carrying stock. On average, I anticipate a monthly increase in net profit from the current $330 to $430. In addition, the proceeds obtained from carrying passengers will help me to meet my loan obligations without any delays. A $100 increase in monthly net profit will mean better savings and higher wages for my assistant. Overall, the project will give my business a new beginning.",0.53086452155065911,0.55186502558376438,1

I have always had interest to venture into the livestock industry and especially the dairy business. This is due to my personal interest in  livestock while growing up in a Maasai setting where we have always treasured livestock keeping. But having watched my father straggle to keep tens of the traditional zebu cattle in the traditional maasai way of herding, and the annual drought  problem that would usually wipe out entire stocks,i developed a  desire to do dairy farming on a professional level,  through zero grading as opposed to herding, and also keep  pedigree dairy cows as opposed to the traditional zebu's whose milk production is low.  Gradually after the dairy business is self sustaining  i would also like to venture into poultry and goats farming on the 3 Acre peace of land that i am doing the business in.I became interested in running  a professional dairy business due to the increasing  demand  for milk within Narok town and it's environment,  Narok is a growing town with  numerious hotels coming  up  in need of milk supply in a addition to the need for milk from residents, Currently milk supply comes from as far away as Limuru (130 kilometres away) and Litein (100 Kilometres away) where there are many profesisonal dairy farmers. Towards commencement of my project i have already built structures (A store, 1 workman's house, Cow shed for 5, fenced off 2 acres for growth of  animal feeds ) and planted animal feeds (Napier grass, sweet potatoes, maize stalks, banana stems) to start the business off. I would like assistance in purchasing two heifers (@ 80,000 KES each), and machinery for making  animal feeds (Electric chaff cutter @  35,000 KES); A plastic tank for water storage @ 65,000 KES, and Miscellaneous costs to enable the project to start amounting to 50,000 KES (Salary payment for the farm hand @ 3,000KES for 5 months = 15,000 KES ; Completion of the cow shed @ 20,000; artificial insemination costs for 2 heifers with a pedigree bull @ 15,000). With an anticipated daily milk production of 15 litres per cow (30 litres per day @ 60 KES = 1800KES  revenue per day); with an estimated operating cost of 500 shillings per day per cow i anticipate to be making a daily profit of 1,300 KES per day, which equals 39,000 KES per month.  After the project starts, i will commit half the profits to the loan payment and the other half will be used to  pay for the construction of a poultry structure on part of the farm and payment for my masters study program in Project management/Management Information Systems.I will supplement the loan amount of US$ 10  with my current capital of  US$ 490 to purchase my second Freshian in-calf. I anticipate to gain an additional 20 ltrs per day after 3 to 4 months  when the cow gives birth . i will be selling the milk at US$ 0.5 per litre hence making  US $ 10 per day from the additional cow. This is in addition to the calf which i will continue breeding if  it's a cow and sell after one year if its a bull.",0.84672092047502179,0.0,1

I am talented in graphic designing, painting and screen printing and as much as I dont have a lot but I offer my skills in mentorship programmes to my fellow youths. I train them to design business cards, brochures, diaries, complimentary slips and burial programmes, also wedding cards.I started as a freelance graphics designer appealing slowly while  in college so as to support my siblings since i am the first born in a family of six and we have been brought up by my mom only.

The design work rewards me with $ 250 monthly which i use for home improvement and part of the money i use for upkeep and food. I also support my siblings and above all, i pay a tenth of it as tithe to my local church.I realized I get so much work sometimes that it is overwhelming that I have to outsource from designers with facilities to do it.At the moment, I am mentoring my two siblings who have finished their O Levels and they have positive attitude towards graphic design.I really enjoy doing graphics and since I have trained  and mentored my brothers , I am sure my sales will tremendously increase thus I will be able to service the loan.With the loan, I will buy more equipments i.e A laptop  worth $ 150 which i can use to design more work as it is portable and it aint as a desktop when there is no power it will mean that i will not be able to deliver the artworks on time.I have small shop of printing, typesetting and photocopying which is located at CBD town.

As a young girl I always aspired to be a graduate when I grew up but the dream was crashed when I finished high school and there was no school fees to go to college hence I had to search for jobs to try and raise cash to go back to school but due to low wages, I used to live hand to mouth for about three years when a well wisher identified me as someone who was not contented with her the then current lifestyle and status. The old woman saw me to campus.I graduated from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology with a bachelors degree in IT in the year 2012. This I must say was a great stepping stone in my life and I was so grateful to God for allowing me a chance to go for higher learning. Being one of the few graduates in the village, I am always passionate about empowering young people in the community and for that reason after graduating I volunteered for one year to work with young girls who are finishing high school in Butere community; Western Kenya to mentor them socially, intellectually and spiritually.I have always wanted to be my own boss and with the help of my entrepreneurship skills and being an outspoken person, I boldly ventured into urban farming last year whereby I am doing poultry farming, vegetables and rabbit keeping with the support of my family.I love baking and pastry, freelancing and interior design. I look forward to being a successful business woman and a home maker some day.My farming business is  approximately 11 months old. I begun with poultry farming; Broiler keeping to be precise and when i realized it was successful, i decided to expand it by selling the idea to my parents who boosted the business by increasing the stock. Today i rear a variety of chickens that is broilers, layers and indigenous chicken. I recently ventured into rabbit rearing since there is a ready market in the supermarkets and 5-star hotels in Kenya. Eating healthy with chemical-free vegetables led me to begin cultivating Spinach and kale whose demand is high locally where very few people  in the urban area do farming. Finally i recently began freelancing in order to advance in the area of my career that is Information and Technology.I chose farming since with foods you can never go wrong. I have invested $ 1,744 in my business. My monthly income is $291 which i generate from vegetables and 100 broiler chickens. I expect to leap my first income from my 21/2 months;200 chicken layers in March when they will start laying and i expect to generate $523 monthly and $116 from rabbits quarterly. I am expecting my first pay of $50 from freelancing in two weeks time.  My expenses go up to $174 and I remain with a surplus of $117 which i reinvest into the business.If i successfully qualify for a loan, i am going to increase the number of birds up to 1,000 which is my target for the next 12 months. This will allow me a gross profit of up to $ 105 daily after selling 30 tray of eggs. Meanwhile with the first loan I will increase the number of birds by buying 3 months old;20 layers chickens at $4 each adding up to a total of $81 and the remaining $22 I will top up buying of feeds whereby a 70kg growers mash goes for $32 and 200-250 pullets consume a 70kg bag within 7 days.This kind of empowerment will allow me a chance to go back to the community and empower young people in becoming financially independent by venturing into entrepreneurship. i look forward to your positive response.NB: Conversion rate $1: Ksh 86.When i receive this loan i will ho and book 250 day old broiler chicks ftom the hatcheries which will be ready for collection within one week. One chick costs Ksh. 60 and rearing the same chick to maturity costs Ksh.250. The chicken will be ready in about 5 to 6 weeks where we sell them in a ready market. One chicken is sold at Ksh. 340 hence giving a profit of Ksh. 90. I will also add  5 drinkers at Ksh. 350, 5 feeders at Ksh. 300 and one chicks cjarcoal jiko at Ksh 1500. The remaining money i will use it for emergency purposes since broilers require a lot of attention.This will enable me to comfortably service my loan and expand my business.

I was born in  Mwatate, which is a location in Taita taveta county in the Coast province in Kenya. Went to primary and later secondary school still in the village. Being the first born in a family of seven children, life was not  easy. Sometimes l could be forced to stay out of school and help my parents cultivate our neighbors gardens so as to put food on the table. Despite the up's and downs, l managed to complete my studies. On completing school, my Uncle came with me to the city where he recided. He helped me enroll to a college named MOMBASA INDUSTRIAL TRAINING CENTRE -(MITC) where l studied Fashions & Designs. On completion, l came out armed with my certificate at hand. I hustled for about two months, then l got a casual job in one of the restaurants around. I started saving on a serious note bearing in mind my background. On the second year, l managed to buy a second-hand manual sewing machine which l used to stitch clothes during my off days and part times. l felt good because l was earning something from what l studied. After working for three consecutive years, l felt it was time to quit. I went around, identified the shop and after considering all the factors, went ahead and started my business. On Sundays after church, my wife, three daughters and I do go to the beach and enjoy God's blessing on our land. This Indian ocean made our people develop a calture of resting on shore every Sunday.

My second born wants to join the military when she grow and the third one wants to be a Hostess in one of the airlines.I'm a football lover.  I do play soccer with a local team. When l get some free time, l do watch gospel songs  on tv and even  football matches on various leagues worldwide.I do design , stitch and sell new clothes. On this civilised world, clothes are very important because NO human being can live without hence making this kind of business stay on demand always. I chose this business whole heartedly because I do feel previlaged to making people look smart and as well stay on the latest and trending fashions. Our prices are always reasonable and also affordable to all classes because there is a choice for everyone. A blouse & skirt can go for 1500 KES and a shirt & trouser for 2000KES.

I went to primary school and secondary school in Meru County and I completed my O level in 1999.I later went to Meru Technical after one year to pursue an accounting course, since my passion was to become a banker or finance manager of a big company in the future. I started at ATC level and I proceeded to do CPA after passing the ATC level. I joined Strathmore University in Nairobi for CPA, whereupon my father decided that I should stay in Nairobi since my mother had passed on so that my studies cannot be interrupted by the loss of my mother.I was able to do the CPA up to part III section V but, due to the competition in the job market, I decided to pursue a degree in business administration at Kenya Methodist University. While in the campus, I got a job with the sacco where I started as an account clerk and was then promoted to an accountant. In the same year I joined the campus, I lost my father after a short illness.I was able to pursue my degree to the end, and I graduated with a bachelor of business administration accounting and finance option in 2012, but I was not able to continue with my CPA to do the final stage, since some of my other siblings were still in college, and the money was not enough to pay for all of our school fees.After working with the sacco for five years, I decided to look for a job in another sector where the work was more challenging for my career growth and development. I was lucky that I got a two-year contract job with an NGO funded by international donors as a project finance and administration officer. After my contract was over, I got a one-year contract with a microfinance institution, where I worked as an administrator and I was also involved in business development, capacity building and groups mobilization.After my one year contract, I joined a local bank as a customer relations officer for two years. I later moved to work with an insurance company up to this date as a financial advisor on savings and investment section. (This was after the bank was acquired by an insurance company.)I started a business not only to help me have income supplement -- since my employment income is not enough to cater for all the needs, as the cost of life is becoming more and more expensive -- but it is also my passion to do business, and it comes as one of my goals in life that one day I will be a business owner and create employment opportunities to the increasing Kenyan population, and enable someone to earn an income to support their family and leave a dignified life.The income from my business helps me to pay for my house rent, buy food and clothes, pay my employee and plough some money back to the business to expand it. I also support some of my siblings back at home. I would like to save more to enable me go back to school to complete my CPA final level and enroll for a master's degree, but the income is still not enough, as the business is still young and in need of more funds to expand it due to the increasing population and the demand of goods and services.During my free time, when I am not in my business or work, I like interacting with an investment group, where we share ideas on different investment opportunities available. I am also a member of a christian fellowship and we meet regularly for prayers.When the idea of doing business come into my maid after working in various sectors way back in 2011, I sat down with a pen and paper and listed down all the possible legal businesses that I could operate, starting with the easiest one to start with the minimum capital that I could afford from my savings, the affordable business licenses, and affordable human labour. This is how I settled on a general shop and first food cafe.After I identified the business, I decided to do a market survey in different areas to identify the best location that I could locate my business. I had several areas that were potential location of my business after inquiring from my friends on those different areas, but I took time to visit these areas and do a feasibility study on the business idea that I was about to carry on in these areas, after analyzing different areas considering different factors such as accessibility, cost of renting the house, security suppliers (or availability of the commodity that I was going to sell) and the target customers I was able to identify.The area where my business is currently located in Juja in Kiambu County. I started my business with a capital of $650 in September 2012. I settled on this area, as my target customers are mostly the students from Jomo Kenyatta University. The area was and is still developing and I realized that there were few shops in the area, and the ones which were around are located far apart from the student hostel. This area being under development, the permanent homes are very few and the number of houses that are being constructed are mostly hostels, targeting the increasing number of student joining the campus.Being once a university student, I understood most of their needs and tastes. I decided to run a general shop in a unique style, selling all the household goods that are mostly the basic need. I also incorporated a first food cafe selling tea and sack and any other light food like chips, chapati, fruits and fruit salad. I target their busy schedules, special occasion like graduations, birthday and weekend parties held in hostels, where I offer different services like catering services.With the increase in number of customers, I now want to expand my business. I seek the help of Zidisha for financial assistance to help me purchase more operating machines. I am currently in need of a fridge for storing beverages, as the majority of these customers need cold drinks most of the time. Other machines that I would like to include in my business are computers; a three-in-one printer, scanner, and photocopier machine; and a bidding machine. This is because most of the student are constantly in need of these services, especially when they are doing their assignments online, others are writing academic research project papers.The business's average income is $293.75 per month with the fixed cost of house rent of $ 81.25, salary $87.50, water and electricity $12.50, licenses $ 46.67, other miscellaneous expense $12.50.

Am the first born in a family of three with two sisters. Both my parents passed on in 1997 my dad and 1999 my mum.  We were brought up by my grandmother at kaloleni estate after my mothers death. I attended primary school at SSD primary in Nairobi where i sat for my KCPE exams in 1998 and high school at Usunge high school Bondo district where i sat for my KCSE in 2002. I  graduated from the Kenya polytechnic with a diploma in business administration in 2007.  After the post election violence of 2007 i got employed as a casual worker at deacons Kenya  ltd which deals in fashion. In 2008 i was promoted to the position of shop supervisor for their shoe store at Sarit center Nairobi called Angelo. In august 2010 i moved from Deacons to Sankara hotel Nairobi as a guest relations agent. I stayed there until April 2014 when the hotel downsized due to low business in the hospitality industry in Kenya as an effect of travel warnings to Kenya by European countries and the United states due to terrorist attacks on Kenya by the al shabbab group in somalia. I used the settlement money to start the business of buying and selling second hand home electrical items and home furnishings at makadara estate Nairobi  in June 2014 which am operating up to dateAfter Sankara downsized in April 2014 i was paid a total of 1200 usd as benefits. Since the economy was not doing well at that time there were no jobs so i opted to use the money to open a used goods store at makadara Nairobi. The main reason for venturing into this business was the low cost required for set up since all i needed was a shop no need for fittings, and i got a shop for 50 usd a month at a location where there were two other shops doing the same trade meaning customers were readily available. So my recurrent expenses are 50 usd per month for rent and 0.25 usd daily city council license fees so total fixed expenditure is 58 usd. I invested 900 usd in the business with the rest going to use for the family. By the end of the year 2014 i had an operating capital of 1300 usd and am projecting 2200 by close of this year. Most people in eastlands area where i operate are low income earners hence many people don't buy new electronics or furniture from shops as they are expensive they buy second hand. Secondly since most people work at industrial area where majority of the companies pay poorly and always delay salaries many people in this areas always sell their household items to get by hence a steady supply of goods and clients at the same time. My most busy months are January Feb March May September when many people sell of stuff to pay school fees. In December i get more buyers as many people have been paid end year bonuses. On a good month i make a net profit of 300 usd and 180 usd on a bad month. My main challenge has been lack of capitalization as at times clients bring in goods and i don't have money to buy so they take them to the competition and this affects my reputation since they may not come back next time assuming i normally don't have capital. Apart from relying on the estate customers i also sell and look for goods from the online classified advertisement company called OLX.From the profits i make 70% goes into family expenses and i always re invest 30% whenever possible.I plan to use the whole loan amount to increase my stock inventory for the shop i run that deals in buying and selling second hand households items. December and january are very active moths in my line of business so the extra credit helps in retaining customers as they wont go to the competition due to lack of funds to buy the second hand items they are selling. Am looking to grow my business through 2016 through the help of zidisha as most saccos which give affordable loans again require you to save a third of the loan amount as guarantee. Considering that i will be tying capital if i go this route it means i will not be able to realize my target growth for 2016. With the help of zidisha am seeing my business grow as projected for the next year.",0.0,0.40703216441039208,0

I joined this course against my will since it is my parents who insisted on me doing it.  I later moved to Mombasa to look for a job but my heart was still not in tailoring. With the help of my friends in Mombasa, I started a pub where I would sell alcoholic drinks.  The business failed after a few months due to my inexperience and lack of adequate financing.  I then decided to start a restaurant where I prepare food and serve the resident around my area.  This is what I am still doing and the business seems very promising. I am a single mother of a 23 year old daughter who is also doing her own business.I run a restaurant where I prepare food to serve the local community.I live in a densely populated area where life is fast and most people do not have time to prepare food at home.  I saw this opportunity and this advised my decision to start the restaurant. My day starts quite early at around 5.00 a.m where I head to the market to buy fruits and vegetables to be consumed for the day.  I then prepare breakfast usually tea and buns to the waiting crowd.  I later prepare lunch and supper and end my day at around 10.00 p.m.  It is a tiresome routine but I am used to it and I am glad the business has kept me going all this time.I make a profit of about $80 per week which I spend to settle my bills and also saving for the future.My restaurant can currently accommodate 12 customers at a time.  With time, the number of customers has grown but my seating capacity has not.  Given this loan support, I would like to increase the capacity to hold 18 customers at a time.

I live in Milimani, Juja, which is located in Kiambu County. I believe that I possess several qualities which make me uniquely qualified to contribute to the community. My educational background, which combines general knowledge with accounting, affords me an uncommon perspective on business.I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Administration at Kenyatta University in my final year. I also hold a Certified Public Accountant (Part II) and I am an aggressive business lady. My background in the complementary areas of business and accounting gives me a special perspective which I will pass to my fellow countrymen.I currently run my own business called NOMKUNGU BOOKSTORE that provides high school, universities and college students with the opportunity to buy, sell and trade used textbooks and school supplies. My business generates approximately $600 as net profit monthly. In a nutshell, I am an aggressive young lady whose intention is to make money and also assist others.My company, which is solely owned, deals with secondhand books and started in the year 2011. My companys name is called NOMKUNGU SECONDHAND BOOKSTORE and is a store providing high school, universities and college students with the opportunity to buy, sell and trade used textbooks and school supplies. In addition to textbooks, students may sell their school supplies like class notes, old newspapers, laptops, accessories or anything that they wish to sell or buy in my store. I used my own book collections as start-up inventory base. In addition, I talked to neighbors, friends and relatives, who donated some of the books. After making these rounds, I managed to get 4,000 books as start-up stock when I opened up for business. My companys goal is to strive to achieve the following:1)Become the leading secondhand book seller in Kenya2)Attract 500,000 customers in the next five years3)Achieve the target of 50,000 visits per month4)Establish sustainable profitability within the first five yearsMy company carries a broad and varied inventory of high school, university and college secondhand textbooks and other materials at all price levels and provides services to help students succeed academically and in an affordable manner. NOMKUNGU SECONDHAND BOOKSTORE generates profitable revenues equal to or exceeding national norms while keeping the cost of retail items competitive for high school, university and college students, and campus community members. I constantly seek to improve my interactions with customers and have invested a lot of time and resources in the business.Operating a used book store is a like owning a recycling center: it is not too glamorous but very profitable. My company generates almost $6,700 per year as net profit. I buy old textbooks averagely at $2 and sell them averagely for $5, therefore making an average profit of $3 per textbook. In addition, school supplies like class notes, old newspapers, laptops, accessories make a profit of $100 per month.I need a loan so as to maintain and increase my businesss current inventory. After receiving the loan last time, I managed to source a specialized point-of-sale system software that has facilitated easy categorization on inventories of used books. This has boosted my business and has definitely increased my profit since I am now able to manage my revenue.Being January, many parents are taking their children to school and most university students are going back to campus. Since it is a high season for my business, I need a loan to acquire more inventories of used books. I receive approximately 30% to 35% of the buying value after selling the books. After receiving the loan, I intend to add more used books, each retailing at an average of 2 dollars, since it is the high season. This will add additional revenue of approximately 2,500 dollars per month. Please fund me, Zidisha.",0.70501353115589893,0.0,1

I am the second child in a family of four. I had my basic education at Obuasi in the Ashanti Region, and continued on to the senior-high level at Cape Coast in the Central Region. I then proceeded to the University for Development Studies at Wa in the Upper-West Region of Ghana, where I studied Environment and Resource Management. After years of job searching proving futile, I began to combine what l had learned during my four years at the University with one of the talents in my family. We are gifted with the talent of designing African wear; we use African traditional prints to make clothing. Ghana has a convergence of many tribes, making it a beautiful atmosphere in which to enjoy the differences of the various ethnic groups.  I am self-employed, designing and making African wear. I entered this business due to my passion for African clothing made from African prints, and because of my desire to become a successful entrepreneur in the near future. My hobbies are reading, swimming, preaching and listening to sermons.I design and make clothing. I have been doing this for over 3 years. I design and sew both women's and men's clothing, and I also sew school uniforms. I combine various African and foreign prints to produce unique designs for individual and retail customers. The clothing also is unique because I combine the traditional with the modern. My products are of good quality, and my clients prefer that I also make clothes for those whom they refer to me. I have 3 apprentices helping me. My goods are in high demand because my pricing is fair. People prefer to buy from me because I offer them credit, especially salaried workers. My typical costs are: $100 monthly for water and electricity, and $60 monthly to rent two shops. On average, I make a revenue of about $500. So, my net profit is $340 in an average month. My profit is used for paying my siblings' school fees and for buying more fabric for my business.This loan when fully funded will be used to buy more fabrics and thread for my work. This will pave way for me to be able to meet demands by my customers and retailers.

I cant complain because am in perfect health and this I consider to be my greatest asset because  it will make me reach my goals in life.  I was born in a family of three girls and one boy and I happen to be the only girl who has been educated upto University level. All this I owe to my loving parents who have been very supportive despite their economic challenges. I come from a region that is considered to be dry in Kenya. We receive very minimal rainfall and most of people in our community do not rely on agriculture. Instead they engage in business activities to earn a living. Most of the young people, who complete ordinary education, end up in the capital Nairobi where they end up in businesses or unskilled labor in the industrial area.  I consider myself to be passionate about business because I started business while in high school. I remember one time I got into trouble because of selling sweets to my school mates. This is a business that I did most of the time and I made good profits that kept me going through my schooling time. When I joined campus, I still got involved in printing business on campus. It is from this background that I was able to start a supplies business that is really making me achieve some of my short term goals. Im able to pay my rent and other bills from the stationary and other materials that I supply to small companies in Nairobi. I live alone in a one bed room apartment and I also pay school fees for my younger sister who is in high school.I supply fresh produce to high end homes in Nairobi. Initially I was doing office supplies that helped me to create good customers who now need fruits and vegetables. I used to buy fruits and vegetables from brokers in the market but I later discovered that I could still grow my own vegetables and supply to my customers. My customers really like e because im honest and reliable. Whenever they make their orders, I deliver them in time. I also give them discounts when they make bulk orders. Some of my customers have been so good that they keep referring me to their friends. This has been a very good trend amongst my female customers who have kept me going all this far. I started growing my own crops early this year when my sister allowed me to use a small piece of land that was lying idle in his plot that is awaiting construction. From this plot I have been able to learn how to do profitable agribusiness within town and target the upper class. From my first harvest I was able to make $240 in profits.This was just from a small piece of land that was not being used by the owner. I believe that if I get more land and inputs like fertilizers I will be able to increase my outputs because water is not a problem where I do the cultivation of vegetables. Besides this vegetables business, I am also a part time tutor and Im able to pay some of my bills such as rent and electricity from this work. Lending me $290 will facilitate improvement of my agri business and also lead to creation of more opportunities for others. Our country is moving towards food security and as business people we need to embrace and support  upcoming farmers who will in future make a difference.With the new loan i will be able to purchase fertilizer and seeds to produce my own vegetables and supply them to my clients. The profit margin will be high and i will be able to repay the loan and increase my capital to expand the business.",0.43209171298941218,0.80146909934505928,1

With current savings of Ksh.20,000 this loan will complement my savings and see me realize my dream.With a motorbike supply will be faster and convenient even during rainy seasons.A lot of time will be saved that can be put in other aspects of the business.Profit is also expected to increase by 8 percent. With increased profit i will able enhance financial support to my dependants.",0.4794842785564295,0.33935372418755116,1

I am the third born in the family born among three beautiful ladies:Marion, Evelyne and Phoebe. We reside in Deacons estate past Kivulini estate neighboring the new Kenya Power plant. I am trained manager by Profession with a bias in the procurement realm. I went to school at Thika primary school where I graduated with 388 marks out of 500. I then progressed to join high school at Thika High School here I studied for four years and graduated with a C+. I then joined Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology where I took a management course in Purchasing and supplies management and graduated with a diploma in the year 2011. I then progressed to work as a Warehouse Clerk with Wilmar Agro Limited before joining Orange Kenya where I worked as a Logistics Assistant until my contract expired late last year.It is due to the hard economic strains and desire to advance my career in future: that motivated me to start a business, also to help me pay some bills here and there. Most of my income goes to my savings account as I want to achieve the above mentioned dreams. I also aspire to enlarge my business through earnings since being self employed is the most self actualizing status to attain.From my savings I was able to start a small business that deals with selling shoes. I sell both second hand (mitumba) as they are locally called and brand new shoes. I had initially begun with dealing with mitumba but as the market demands and trends dictate I decided to include the new ones later on. Both men and women in this town are trendy people and the town being an educational centre as well as administrative tends to provide a large and able clientele basis. I started with a stock of worth 11000 and this has grown to 36000 as of this date. The profit margin generated per piece varies from each piece and the negotiating power of the customers hence I am able to raise 300 on the least to 1000 on a good bargained item. The clientele base that I have established prefers to buy from me as I do take the goods and to their offices at their convenience, an approach that has contributed to the fast growth of my business. My customer relation skills also lure them to me as well as encouraging their friends to buy from me which none has ever regretted to do.Operational costs vary from time to time due to some factors I will mention below. First the local authorities are not consistent in collecting the authorized amount from traders and when they come they extort more than that as they normally like to be bribed failure to which they threaten to arrest us. This poses the greatest risk in my venture. Secondly, I have not been able to find a stable premise for the business hence fluctuating costs of operation though averagely they range from 7000-11000.To begin with i must express my gratitude for the first loan that was rendered to me. it has really transformed my life significantly.with the loan i am applying, i intend to increase the stock in my business, we are in a festive season of Christmas and i must say business is good hence i was able to pay my previous amount collectively. i will buy more shores and stock some more complementary goods like hand bags and belts that my clientelle base has been raising demand on.",0.72617999855974624,0.48835656944323341,0

I the year 2008 I started a cyber caf business. It is located in a small town called Githurai Progressive. Through this business I have been able to cater for most of my family need. I have been struggling to expand my business thats why I hereby apply to zidisha to grant me a loan so as I can move to the next level.This loan will go entirely on purchase of extra stationary for sale during the return to school period of May 2014. I also intend buy memory sticks,flash disks and add books, pens, pencils and other learning materials are highly needed by students living in Githurai area.This will help minimize the costs the parents incur when they go for them 12km away as they do now. I will use the loan you lend me to build shelves within my cyber where i will stock various materials used when learning.This is something that some of my customers have asked me to stock and i have already put up an advertising poster to proclaim that the materials will be there. I therefore kindly request for this loan in order to expand my business where i leave my wife to run as i go for job in the public transport where i would like to venture in the future.

This will be enough stock to make me earn enough capital that I will use to start a small business of repairing computers and buy the equipments required around my place. There is scarce for a computer technician in my area and I have decided to take this opportunity and grab that chance. I am sure by September I will have taken the greatest steps into the business if I get the loan.

My father had two wives and I am the fifth born of my mother. I started schooling when I was five years at Rongai primary school and went on to Kinyogori high school and later on to Kenya school of business studies where I did a Diploma in business management. I faced a lot of challenges growing up since we were very many in our home and our Dad could not sufficiently provide for us. Many are the times I was at home due to lack of school fees, my uniforms we always worn out and in patches, I depended mostly on bursaries and food was always very scarce. When I recall my early childhood life, I just thank God for it was purely his mercies that saw me through. I am very happy to be accepted to join Zidisha and I feel that this is another of many blessings that God has given me.I graduated in 2011 and started searching for a job that would sustain and cater for my needs. Finding a job became a big challenge as jobs are very scarce in Kenya. I spent a whole year without a job before I decided to start my own business. I borrowed some money from my elder brother and started buying fruits from farmers and other traders and selling them in our local market. I deal with apples, oranges, bananas, pine apples, Avocados, grapes and other types of local fruits. The business has been providing for me and for my family. I have a wife and two lovely girls. My children are still young to know what they want to be once they grow up but I pray that they will be good citizens and will lead successful lives. I have a hobby of playing football during my leisure time and on Sunday afternoons; we meet with my peers at our church playground for some fascinating matches.My business is selling fruits, fruit puddings and fruit juices. I started this business over the last two years and has been providing for me and my family. Fruits are part of the diet in most households and a prescription to many people who wants to live a healthy life. Most of my peers whom we play football with take fruit juices during and after exercises and matches. The reason I choose this business is because the people within and around the locality love eating fruits and drinking fruit juices for healthy living. Fruits are always in high demand.  The cost of running this business is not very high and is very manageable. During dry seasons, its very difficult to get some fruits like oranges, bananas and grapes. I travel to other counties where fruits do well and it takes a lot of bargaining to secure a good take.  I spend about 10 to 20 dollars depending on the market prices to buy the fruits and bring them to the market.  Some fruits are highly perishable and go bad quickly however business is not that bad either especially on market days. After selling them and deducting my expenses, am left with 18 dollars or 20 dollars on a good market day.  I use this money to pay for my house rent, pay school fees for my daughters who dreams to be Lawyer and a Teacher ,and provide food for my family. I am always re investing part of my profits to keep my business going and all this thank to Zidisha family who introduced me to My Kind lenders whom have boosted my Business when they advanced me with my first loan.Following successfully purchased a Blender using my first loan, If my second loan is funded, I will purchase a Fridge to conserve fruits which I will now be purchasing in bulk during rainy seasons without the fear of them going bad and this will ensure that my customers will not lack their flavors even if in dry seasons where some of fruits become scarce or too much expensive.This will also minimize the wastage of blended juice,where I usually cant predict the numbers of customer who will visit me in a particular day.At a time I may blend less juice which will led to complains from my customers who are my Kings and Queens or blend more juice than the numbers of customers,Which force me to give out for free to my friend and relatives to avoid it from going bad as my customers only take fresh juice.At a number of time my customers have proposed this to me and I have visited an electronic shops to negotiate on how they can sell me a fridge at a loan but have totally disagreed.Now I find this chance that only My family Zidisha lenders can assist me to grow my business to another steps through lending me a Loan and this will empower me to raise more revenue to Educate my daughters,grow my community as well as my beloved country.",0.39754308623384482,0.78694583312128163,1

I bought this piece of land in the year 2003. This was through the business that I operate in this area. My three kids are in school and the business has been of great help in terms of paying their school fees. The business that I operate is motorcycle and bicycle  repairing. This is a business that has been good since I started it in the 90s. With the coming of the motorcycles, the business improved as the services that I offer to repair them are usually changed higher compared to when I repair bicycles. I am hoping to improve this business to a higher level with this loan that I will get from Zidisha organization.I repair motorcycles and bicycles at the shopping center. I started repairing bicycles in the year 1996 at Kiptangwanyi. At the moment, bicycles were the main means of transport and they were widely used in this area. The area of Kiptangwanyi and its surroundings is usually relatively flat and this has made it convenient to use bicycles in transporting and also movement from one area to another. This made me to have so many customers to offer the services of bicycle repairing. Later, the coming of motorcycles was good news and the business took a new and positive direction. People bought them and I started also to repair them. Slowly by slowly things changed and I was able to offer the services, At the moment I am now able to offer services to both the bicycles and motorcycle operators. I have also opened a spare parts shop at my business and I am able to make good profit from the business. The main challenges that the business encounter are poor roads especially during the rainy season and fluctuating prices of spare parts in the world marketI wish to use this loan that I will be granted to improve my business by doing the following. firstly, I would like to buy an electrical compressor.

It helps in sustaining my family and besides the challenges here and there,we have never lacked something to eat and enjoy together.When I started the business,I never had all the necessary equipments and most of the packaging was manual though upto date I am still doing some other work manually.I have managed to buy a fridge to keep my raw milk for a longer time and still fresh  and the packaging now is done on plastic bottles which is a step further from the polythene papers I used to pack in.I am a go-getter and believe that one day,I will have a big processing plant that will be automated.This will be a dream come true for me.I would also like to expand and venture into other products to increase my returns with your support.My business entails processing of raw milk to yoghurt.It has sales of at least 20 dollars (kshs 2,000) per day. Out of this,I get profit of about 10 dollars (kshs. 1,000) per day.On a monthly basis,I get profit  income of at least 360 dollars equivalent to kshs 30,000 when the business is low.The sales may go as high as kshs. 60,000 monthly.I believe with the quality of my product and the good connection of friends I have,this has brought a positive change in my business.The challenge here is that the demand is high but the finances are limited.What I get as returns,I mostly use it to plough back to the business by buying the raw products that help in making the yoghurt.I do business in a hot-weather area and people here must use something to quench their thirst and avoid dehydration.With my favorable prices,my yoghurt is preferred to others in the market.With financial support (loan),I would expand my business by creating a website and employing at least 2 marketers to increase on revenue.I have never failed in my business but I have faced challenges in handling the sensitive raw milk. It used to spoil due to improper handling and lack of fridge but that is a gone case so far.I believe with your support,I will grow to be a big company and Zidisha will be behind all this.ThanksI will use my Loan in getting barcodes for my product.The barcodes cost approximately $260.This will make my Yoghurt have some shelf space in small and bigger supermarkets.This is one of the rules for any product to have some shelf space.I believe with this achievement,my sales will drastically change and hence a boost in profits too.I promise to work with you for the betterment of my company.I thank zidisha for the growth my company has experienced so far.You are really making me achieve more in my life.Thank you very much",0.0,0.50326743514792383,1

This is what drives me to make a living and make a better life for myself. I live with my family and life is good, however, I took on responsibilities very early in life. I'm a fish vendor and I'm proud of it because it allows me to be independent and work for myself. I have a high school education and graduated at a good level, but I was interested in selling fish and decided to get started, I do not regret it because I'm doing fine.As I said above, when I knew what I wanted, I quickly took on responsibility and threw myself into the sale of fish. My job is to wake up very early each day to go to the fish market, buy in bulk and sell them on to my customers. It's a job that excites me because I have a good customer base and this motivates me. I note that there is competition, but my edge is that my fish are fresh, unlike others that sell frozen fish. My clientele often require me to deliver fish to them at home. As my profits increase, I increase the amount that I buy and this allows me to satisfy my clientele. Now other sellers come to my business to buy stock to sell elsewhere, which is why I need your loan to strengthen my sales.I need the loan Zidisha to improve my business for the customer base. As the business grows and demand increases, I need enough money to buy enough stock to satisfy everyone. At first, I was selling to consumers, but now other sellers come to buy stock for their own businesses because they say that my fish are always fresh and this is what their customers want too. That's why I need your loan to buy fish in bulk to sell to my own clients and vendors who come to me.",0.72774274299277097,-0.57345066344101592,0

I am  a second born in a family of four. I underwent  my primary education in lower solai in nakuru and later joined Lake Nakuru secondary School. I am single with two children one who completed her secondary education in the year 2012. I started selling Charcoal in Kiserian in Nairobi, then I was selling charcoal to kiserian town residents. Later I relocated to Kitengela where cost of operation was low. From my previous charcoal business, I was able to purchase a plot in Nkoroi area near Kiserian and constructed four room residential houses. I have rented this rooms though they are are still incomplete therefore the rent income is abit low. However they have been of great importance to me since I was able to educate my daughter up to form four level. The income from my business was also used for family upkeep and helping my parents back home. I also have interest in farming and have been doing it in my home place where i have rented a 1 acre of land in bahati nakuru and have been planting wheat and tomatoes and the returns are encouraging.The main product i sell is Charcoal. The demand for charcoal here is on the rise since its affordable to the population around. With a group of about three, we hire a lorry that transports the product rom Narok where we obtain the the charcoal at a lower price. Charcoal is sold in bags and a bag goes for Ksh. 700 from the supplier. the same bag I sll it at Ksh. 1500 minus Ksh 150 per bag that I pay for transport. this brings a profit of about Ksh. 650 per bag. I also sell the same in small quantities and this is where its more profitable than selling in whole sale. A bag may result to about Ksh 2000 when sold in small measurements. In a good day, I can sell up to five bags while in other days i can selljust one. On average I do sell about bags at average of Ksh 1000. This translates to an average income of about Ksh 40000 per month and after paying all the expenses (Rent, security, labour e.t.c) I have about Ksh 20000 which is Net profit and I use the money to pay for my family upkeep, school fees and the rest to savings account. I am not the only supplier of this product. we are about 5 in the neighbourhood and most of the time we work together especially during purchasing so that we increase our bargaining power and reduce the cost. I have my regular and permanent customers whom i even deliver the product to their homes so that to maintain a good relations and make them loyal.With my third loan, I  to concentrate much on wholesaling. Our major supplies are from Narok County, this will require adequate storage space and adequate finance to cater for both bulk purchasing and transport.  Currently I have a semi permanent shed that I have been using for both retail and wholesale. I have  identified a trusted person who will be in charge of retail as this is more demanding since most customers buy a bag or less.While out there, I want to deliver as much as I can to those customers that so far rely on me. I have once delivered to far places like Limuru and Kinangop. This however can be more profitable if am delivering more bags as opposed to few since overhead costs are high. I am exploring possibility of soon delivering regularly to far places like Limuru and Kinangop and Naivasha after I obtain the licence to do so. I have confidence in this business having been in it for long and I am aware of the challenges. Also I have made several long term customers who are reliable. My future plans are to acquire own means of transport as transport costs reduce profit margins. I am hopefully that with your support, this initiative will be a success.",0.63174542196689509,0.73532884206413918,1

However they take a commission of 10%  on the sale .Most of the profit i get isre invested in the business.I intend to use the loan to top up my savings so that i can purchase more stock with a wider variety,  to include ladies bracelets, earrings and necklaces.My plans for the near future is to improve on the variety of the accessories and also open a brick & mortar store so as to reach a wider market.I intend to use the loan to buy new scarves for both men and women as they are in high demand during this cold season. This new stock will help me increase the variety of  items on offer in my online shop as i was previously selling watches only.I look to add different varieties of stock as time goes by.Thank you.",0.7255151101049816,0.78305417325820814,1

Where I live the land is very fertile, bcoz plantation usually do well with farming.I don't have them yet bcoz I'm planning to get married anytime from now, but when I get them I will teach them to follow my footsteps.My hobbies: I like watching movies, footballs, and listening to cool music.My cyber cafe deals with; General Computer Services, Photocopy services, Lamination, Book bindings, Research Projects & Proposals, and Computer Application Packages.My services are very useful to my customers, who always believe in my excellent job services since I started the business....because I work on my professionals. I choose this cyber business, because it is the work I do with passion...I really like it so much.My typical costs and revenue is between 40k to 50k every month to my business.To obtain the profit maximizing output quantity, we start by recognizing that profit is equal to total revenue (TR) minus total cost (TC).An equivalent perspective relies on the relationship that, for each unit sold, marginal profit (M) equals marginal revenue (MR) minus marginal cost (MC). Then, if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at some level of output, marginal profit is positive and thus a greater quantity should be produced, and if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost, marginal profit is negative and a lesser quantity should be produced. At the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost, marginal profit is zero and this quantity is the one that maximizes profit.Since total profit increases when marginal profit is positive and total profit decreases when marginal profit is negative, it must reach a maximum where marginal profit is zero - or where marginal cost equals marginal revenue - and where lower or higher output levels give lower profit levels.With my business profit - I always support family member e.g. Parents, Sisters, Brothers, Some other profits I use to boost my cyber caf business with reinvestment in growing the business with stocks, clearing the bills and other personal activitiesalso looking forward of expanding it to something big, because my dream is to become a very big entrepreneurs with Gods will, it is something I do believe myself since my childhood time.I always that no matter the hardships I face God has good plans to my life and nobody can change from me.Lenders, accept my special thanks for the generosity you all have on me. For accepting my loan proposal, I want to use my third loan to buy two computer machines, each machine will cost $300 so that my clients will get computer availability to use in my cyber cafe. I call upon all of the lenders to stand by me and support my business project for funding, because my vision is to succeed and help my entire community village which I believe I can do it, and I do promise never to let any lender down who support me with his/her money.

I schooled at Kibuk primary school for two years; class one and two, we migrated to another division where i attended Kaborom primary in class three to class six, this school was about 7km away from where we were living. Due to the large family and low income our parents opted for this school because it was among the few sponsored by the Action-Aid Program. They believed we will be helped in future in terms school fees but it didn't happened, we transferred to another school this was after migration due to inter-community clashes that erupted in 1992. I managed to finish my KCPE examination then i jointed Moi high school Kaptama in which I did my KCSE examination in 2001. To get school fees was not easy; we were doing causal work on weekend and holydays. After 6 years I was sponsored to go to college I did Advanced diploma in computer Engineering. I was lucky I got a chance in one of the media house employed as station Technician for 2 years the salary was too low and working conditions poor I decided to quit.I tarmacked for a whole year looking for favorable salary and I got employed at Alphax College as computer Technician but the things were the same. This now forced me start my own workshop where i repair computers and other electronics. In this region Technician are few and people need their valuable service. My boy wants to become an engineer or pilot in future thats why am trying all means to give him good education.What I like most doing is playing keyboard in the church and few graphic designs i also like travelling and exploring new places.My major area of specialization is computer and electronics. In Decitech technologies I do installations, maintenance and repairs of computers, printers, scanners and broadcasting equipment. I am planning in future to do sales of electronic equipments if I get funds.In the whole country many institutions, individuals have acquired and they still in demand of the services.  The upcoming, expanding, existing companies/institutions need replacements of the worn out equipment and some need new equipment. The country has adopted computerization because it is efficient and accurate when it comes to communication and data storage in the offices, schools, businesses, homes.Am passionate about this kind of business or job, equally I have knowledge and skills in which i serve my clients to satisfaction.  since my tender age, I was disassembling small radios, disco watches and trying to get solution to the faulty once, I used to ask, seeing what other Fundis (wiremen) were doing and even when I was in High school I repaired radios for my teachers until they called me technician, the physics teacher was impressed with the grade I got in my Final exams. The technology itself is growing rapidly and there is demand for such goods and services in region.Typical costs I incur include: workshop rent per month- Kes 3,000, business permits annually- Kes 9,500 consumables: electricity kes.700, Revenue is strictly from my services not constant but approximately Kes 15,000 per month. The small profit I get goes to support my sisters college fees, my children schooling and my family upkeep sometimes it not enough. Am sure if get funds to expand my business I will make good profit and even invest.It has been the desire of heart to acquire N-computing device for my smooth running of the cyber then this the time because if i get USD.359.38 it will enable me to purchase this device that cost USD.400.

I attended primary school and secondary. Though I managed to complete school, I went through a lot of hardships. Having lost my parents at an age of six, I was helped by my relatives.Due to pressures they did have in our extended family, I had to find a way to make a rightful living. I didn't get help to join college. I regret why I didn't perform well in my exams to attain marks to join campus. I do know that education is valuable in life, but I know that I can get to rise and be someone of importance like Bill Gates.I am single, trying to work hard to be financially stable so that I can think of marriage. I am hoping that everything will work out well so that my children may not go through what I did go through. I want them to have the best that I can provide for them.It is through hard work that I managed to raise capital of $232 to start a secondhand shoe selling business. To get this capital, I worked different jobs as a nanny or house help and did garden work too. It took me two and a half years. I really needed patience, perseverance and determination to realize this. Life is hard in Kenya, but one has to try out his or her best, aiming high always.I then got a stall at Kibuye in the market where I started my business. I buy my stock from the neighboring country Uganda because they are cheap there, and then I sell them in Kenya to make a profit of $5 to $8 per pair of shoes.The key to success is to meet the demand for an upscale women's and men's shoe store with a wide selection and focused customer attention.Objectives of my shoe resale store1.To create a productbased retail store whose primary goal is to exceed customers expectations.2.To increase the number of clients served by 15% per year by serving an unmet need with outstanding selection and customer service.3.To develop my business surviving off its own cash flow.Mission To provide an upscale selection of women's and men's shoes and outstanding customer service. When I adhere to this, everything will fall in its place. My service will exceed the expectations of my customers.ProductThese are the categories of shoes that I sell: sandals, loafers, stylish shoes, dress shoes, canvas athletic/ stylish shoes. My business strives to have one of the largest selection of shoes in Kisumus Kibuye Market.Market analysisMy shoe resale business targets two distinct groups of fashion  conscious females and male shoppers, professional workers and housewives. While both groups are interested in dress shoes, the professionals will be looking for fashionable shoes they are able to wear with their business attire. The housewives might be looking for fashionable but more casual shoes.Market segmentationTargeting two different population segments within the broad category of fashion  conscious females and males with disposable income.1.Professionals: these are full-time working professional men and women working in Kisumu and its environs. They typically earn more than $200 p.m. They will purchase shoes for the workplace as well as for leisure time.2.Housewives: the household income of this group is $70 - $150, generally towards the higher end of that range.Advertisement These markets are targeted through my attractive eye-catching storefront in my stall; this enables me receive walk-through customers.My business deals with the retail of both new and secondhand shoes, which I purchase from a neighboring country, Uganda, delivering them to my stall for sale.My monthly expenses are as follows:Rent $27.00Electricity and water bills $ 8.60My salary $80.64Transport $ 16.12 (twice in a month to and from Uganda)My sales in a month $ 200.00Less expenses$ 133.00Profit $67.64 My profit in a month ranges from $65.00 to $75.00. This I use in the purchase of more inventory.This second loan will help me increase my inventory a big deal as compared to my first loan. I want to increase my inventory and purchase them once from Uganda in one trip so as to cut down my transport cost to approximately 40% from $ 16.12 to $ 9.00.Adding to the profit I currently have ($69.00), if my loan gets fully funded ($200) then I will be in a position to purchase stock worth $270.00, from which I expect returns of 60% , which will aid me in paying my installments in time. Reploughing back the profits will ensure continued flow of returns, hence ensuring I pay my installments without any hindrance.I would like to thank Zidisha Inc. and my lenders for the support and in helping me better my business.

My earnings come entirely from my online business mostly about article writing, data entry and transcription services. Last year in August i decided to empower stay-at-home moms and the youths by introducing them to online jobs. So far i have managed to train over 60 stay-at-home moms, most of whom have already started earning lots and lots of money, and becoming self-empowered.... Thus my source of income also comes from the regular trainings that i hold... my hobbies, i love writting, a lot, i love watching movies and i love helping the less fortunate in the society.... I am a mother to the most beautiful baby in the world... yes, am yet to find anything as cute as my butu :)One of my other side hustles for the past one and a half years has been farming. I do farm potatoes back in the village in Narok County for commercial purposes. I currently have 7 acres of potatoes which are due harvesting in two weeks time. An acre of potatoes will cost me about  $60 to lease out for a year, the seedlings to plant will cost me around $150 and labor plus tractor will cost me around $200. The good thing with potatoes is they take only 3 months in the farm, so when all else remains constant i.e. whether etc, i will have three planting seasons in a year. On average, an acre of potato will produce 50-70 bags, on the lowest side 50 bags and on the highest side sometimes up to 110 bags. A bag goes for between $30-$50 depending on the prevailing market price as well as the demand and supply of the same.First off i want to thank all those who have been funding me in the past. I want to continue expanding my online business with more computers, more desks et al to be able to accomodate more trainees in my program in any given time.

The competition named Sage Literary Talent is designed to inculcate a good reading habit in school children and that is as part of our ongoing effort to championing a reading revolution in our dear nation Ghana.  Having this as stake, I deem it necessary to invest more money into running the competition to foster the program to a successful patronage and to the benefit of all.I wish to apply for a loan of $220.00 for the expansion of my business. by the grace of God, i have been able to reconciled with my almost lost clients and would now be looking up to me in terms of supplying story books them. what i want to do now is, start a literary talent competition for school children, which would comprise, reading and writing, poetry and illustration. by implementing this, i would be selling story books in and out of our books season in Ghana. and also, my profit margin would have gone up by 20%.example.... books sold to my clients at a whole sale price of  $1.90 minors  20% =$1.58 approxmeanwhile, books soled at a retail price is $2.60 and does not attracts no percentage discount. So if i am giving the nod for the loan amount requested, i shall invest it in the literary talent competition, where the books would be sold at a retail price and make more profit.

I am a junior high school graduate. the truth is that i was not academically good whiles in school and i had learning difficulties from childhood but i have two younger brothers and a small girl( sister) and they are very brilliant with books.As a results of the above situation, i had a problem with been punctual at school because i was most times laughed at. But  in all these, i was good at sales. so i used to sell coconut on weekends at a nearby market. As a results, i learn all i could learn about coconut business.The actual day came when i completed junior high school, my parents sat me down and talked to me about starting a full time coconut business and as a results they can concentrate on sending my junior siblings to school since they were more good with school. i did not decline, and they gave me some money which i started with. over the years, i think that decision has been one of the best i have made as a young man. i make a lot of profit, and i help my parents to take care of my siblings too and at the end of the day we are all happy.i hope to expand my coconut business, buy an additional wheel barrow and employ some people in the trade come the future. I am hardworking and i love successful people even if they are not celebrities but are content with the little they have done with their lives. Lastly, i hated mathematics in school but not English and that was the subject they ridiculed me on. am grateful in advance for the help and support that you are about to extend to me. God richly bless you allI sell coconut in my community to the thirsty public considering the heat of the scorching sun. So in short i am a coconut Business man ,a name they all call me in my community. it is funny but i love it.As a results of the heat currently in Ghana and in my community, the people in my community most especially government workers and others do take in a lot of liquid and thus making the demand on coconut in hot afternoons very very high and it has some health benefits too.I choose this kind of business because it was very easy to start and with a minimum credit amount. you can buy and sell, or sell and pay the owner of the coconut later and keep your small profit but it is always best to buy it and sell.It has a high profit yield, when you invest say a $100, you make around a 55%-60% on the invested capital. Thus, a $100 can get me about 450 pieces which i can sell within some 12 days in good market days and seasons such as we have now and in 14 to 20 days in the rainy seasons. I have a savings account with a local rural bank even though they will not give a loan to a coconut business man, i still save with them for my own good, i then help with the school needs of my siblings , i reinvest a small percentage and i live on the rest.This loan when funded, it will help me a lot as it will set me on the road to own a wheel barrow and thus start a full time coconut business . To the people of my community, they will always have sweet coconut to quench their thirst, and also enjoy the heath benefits thereof.....When and if my loan is fully funded, i will invest the entire amount into my business. i will buy close to 1000 Pieces of coconut with the entire $200. When i sell them which will take less than two months, i expect to make a profit of not less than a $100 or more which is about 50% of the loan. this will help me to make the payments as expected of me. i therefore expert an increase in profit margin with the introduction of this new aid from the lenders on Zidisha.",0.0,0.54491839584982282,1

Left teaching career, and ventured in small scale farming from 2002 to 2004. I left farming the following year and went to Nairobi in search of employment. While in Nairobi I also ventured into small scale merchandised business where I used to earn a living in Kangemi slum. My business despite a stiff competition was doing fairly well because my prices was competitive to other well established entities with sufficient capital and enough stock. My capital base grew in a span of less than three years from Kenya shillings fifty thousand to Kenya shillings three hundred and fifty thousand making a net return of at least Kenya shillings one thousand per day. I was not able to expand my business due to capital constraints despite a good business growth potential.In December 2007, I lost my entire business due to presidential post election violence because I was operating in a semi- permanent premise and insecure place with no insurance cover.I joined Vision Institute of Professionals College in Nairobi and finished my Certified Public Accountant (CPA) course in 2010. I worked for Simba Telcom Ltd as an accountant from July 2010 to October 2011. I left that company and Joined Transmara Sugar Company from November 2011 to date as a payroll accountant besides being a secretary of the supervisory Committee of Transmara Sugar SACCO.MY BUSINESS AND FARMINGI Victor Mogoi Mose I am a small scale sugarcane farmer currently owning three acres of developed cane which is fourteen months old on a leased land for six years lease cost fully paid for the entire lease term. Cane farming requires huge capital hence not easy  expand the same and also farming risks cause a huge treat to farming industry like low cane prices offered to farmers from millers, illegal cheap sugar damping in Kenya, inaccessibility of  farming subsidies from the government and cheap Sugar imports from COMESA region. Due to above risks associated with farming, I decided to venture to a merchandised retail shop to diversify my risks at Kiango Market from May 2013 to date in a permanent rental premise. I injected Kenya shillings 200,000 into the business and employed one sales lady in charge of the shop. I stay in the same premise and always audit my sales daily in the evenings after finishing the work of my employer. Business is also growing but needs good capital injection. Currently I hire a motorbike to make deliveries to my customers who also operate small kiosks in both Kisii and Narok Counties in a radius of up to twenty five kilometers. I pay averagely Kenya shillings five hundred shillings daily to the owner and pay a rider kshs. 300 per day to make sales of averagely kshs. 20,000. This as a profit margin of at most kshs. 1,500 per day including transport costs. I intend to buy my own motorbike to make deliveries to my clients in order to reduce transport costs because this gives me a competitive advantage to business competitors and also increase stocks which are always insufficient to my customer demands. I sell all household products and few construction products like paints, nails, iron sheets and cements. Customers prefer my shop because I do free deliveries to their doors if they buy substantial heavy products in cash. I intend to expand my business to a wholesale entity but capital is my biggest business constraint. My potential is overwhelmingly huge coupled with perfect customer service from my sales lady. I always close my shop at 9.00 pm and open at 7.00 am daily except Sundays.  From my small business I make averagely on a monthly basis Kenya shillings 20,000 after paying all my utilities and my sales lady. These can substantially improve if I meet my customer demands.To my Dear Lenders,I greet you all.First and foremost let me again appreciate your lending to me which indeed is changing my life greatly.

I was born in Kisumu but lived most of my life in Nairobi. I schooled at Highway secondary school. Then pursued a diploma in Electrical Engineering at the Kenya polytechnic.During my primary and high school years i had this great desire to go for camping but my parents could not afford to pay for any of these trips whether by school or church.  The desire for camping was so great that i looked for every opportunity to go  for a  free camp through joining the  scouts and st. Johns ambulance clubs in high school.After college i started volunteering to help at kids camps at the scripture union of Kenya and later trained as a team building facilitator through Young Life USA. This made me to be able to organized and facilitate group camps to finer details.With this knowledge at hand i venture out to start my own events management company. I facilitate Team building as well as organize and facilitate low budget affordable group camps for kids and youths from different institutions.Unlike Earlier years Kenyans are becoming more and more interested in spend their holidays on a camping trip and hence a high demand for camping Equipment. I believe that I am strategically placed to meet this emerging need.I am married with two kids. My hobby actually ended up becoming my carrier.I am an events manager, i facilitate team building for corporates and run group camps for various institutions. I also hire out camping equipment such as Tents, sleeping bags, cutlery and camping activities equipment .Kenya has been ranked third in a global survey of economies projected to register the fastest growth this year, placing the country ahead of other emerging markets in Africa.This mean more investors, companies and job opportunities. As this happens , it open more opportunities for companies to include team building as part of their day to day running. For this , they need competent team building facilitators which i 100% believe i am.I chose to venture in this business since it first of all give me satisfaction, secondly i get to meet peoples need and help them come up with applicable solutions and lastly it brings food to my table.A team-building session will give me an income of between  $100 to $ 2500 per day depending on the size of the group that i am facilitating.While for the camping tents, i charge $ 2 per person per day .At the moment my business is still picking up and i cant afford to have full time employees.I normally hire casual laborer who i pay from the profits. I also use the profit to support my family and keep my kids in school. A part from this i fund a childrens orphanage (Green Village Hope Childrens Center) that helped found and direct. It is  based in western Kenya. Feel free to google it up. Our site is down for maintenance. or search us on facebookMy ultimate goals is inventing in my own campsite.With this loan i will be able to purchase  a few more  Team building facilitation equipment for about $300. The larger part of it will go into roofing my newly constructed two room (office and retail shop)  which is estimated to cost $1500.This will enable me save $90 monthly, on the monthly rents which i pay for my current temporal office which can be  ploughed  back into the business . The retail shop will be run by my wife . This will keep her occupied and it will also be another source of income for my family.  This will make my family more comfortable and also good payments for two assistants.As i also indicated in my profile , i also run a children orphanage . A percentage of my income goes to the general running of the orphanage ie food , clothe and school stationeries.Overall this will mark my first baby step to achieving my dream of owning a camping site.

I was born in deep rural Nyeri  Central Kenya.  This area has semi-arid climatic conditions and though almost everybody there is a farmer, there isnt much in terms of food production to talk about.  Most people engage themselves in farming of drought resistant crops such as onions and millet.  I went to school like the rest of the children in the area while helping my parents with their daily chores at home. I cleared my secondary school and the urge to get out of home and venture outside that area got the better of me and I decided to look for a college in Mombasa.  Luckily I got an admission to join a hospitality training school in Mombasa which is about 700 kilometers from home  exactly what I wanted.I joined the college and did a course in hotel management and I secured a job after completing the course.  My first job was in a beach hotel in an area called South Coast which is about 20 kilometers south of Mombasa.  I loved this job since it is exactly what I was trained to do and I was able to meet people from different nationalities since the hotel was a tourist resort.Unfortunately there was a slump in tourism activity after a series of terrorist attacks and the hotel closed down due to lack of business.  With no where to take my skills, I decided to change my career and with the little money I had saved, I decided to start selling construction materials mostly house hold sanitary equipment such as cisterns and related accessories.I decided to start this business because Mombasa is a big city which is growing at a very rapid pace.  This has resulted into an explosion of new buildings which are coming up in every corner of the city.  The middle class is also growing fast and most of them are obsessed with owing their own housed.  For this reason, the demand for construction and finishing materials is quite high and I decided to swim along this wave so as benefit from the boom.  I run a small store in the backstreets of Mombasa city where I stock sinks and tubes.  I have a good number of loyal clients who keep coming back to buy from my shop.  The visibility of my store is not very good since I operate in a backstreet and I sometimes forced to sell these items from door to door so as to reach more clients.  I am hoping to open another store in the main streets of the city once the business grows to sustain such a store.  I get most of my stock from big stores where I buy at a whole sale price and then retail the items at a profit.  My profit margin ranges between 20  30%.I currently make a net profit of about USD300 per month and I use this money to support my boy who is in school and for my own upkeep.  This income can grow much more if get reliable and affordable credit.  I believe in Zidisha I have found a reliable partner.As I have been doing, I will use this money to increase stock of hardware materials in my shop.  I will use the entire amount to buy hammers, brushes and other building materials which I will later sell at a profit.  I am optimistic that I will make good sales and realize tidy profit from this venture.  Thank you so much for your continued support.",0.71301881432636216,0.0,1

Went to school in Kisii attending both primary and secondary education. When I finished high school in 2003 I left for Mombasa where I got admitted to Kilifi Technical training College and graduated with a certificate in medical engineering. I tried looking for jobs but couldnt find one easily because of the qualifications I got a certificate I would meet others with degrees or diploma who would have me out listed from the shortlisted candidates.  I have always wanted to do a Diploma and even Degree but money is my main problem. To get to my goal I had to try finding jobs to do which were not of my line of specialization. I had gotten one with Safaricom as a merchandiser. I thought I found a long lasting or permanent job hence starting a family while in Mombasa only to be transferred to Nairobi in 2013 and after the year our contracts were not renewed in 2014. Living in Nairobi is very expensive and due to lack of income I decided to return home in Kisii. But due to my family I thought of starting a business so as to be able to provide my family and to my one year child giving my family the best I could.A food kiosk or small hotel is what I had in mind as I had inherited some piece of land from my parents, and with the land strategically placed near the tarmac and close to a market. Offering my foods to the market vendors meals, and passersby too. There is also a stage at the market place hence I get to offer meals too to drivers and conductors before the omnibuses are to leave for their various destinations. The cost of the business or capital I required was $188.00. This I used to purchase the table $40, chair $ 25 some cutlery $15 the iron sheets $100 which form my walls, and roof. $8 for my miscellaneous expenses. The capital was easily raised from my earlier savings from the jobs I currently had. Though not much because the cost of life keeps on rising daily, and with my family that I have to provide for I saw I will spend the whole money if I cannot put the cash into creating more wealth. This is how I thought of starting a food kiosk and also my passion of cooking would be put into good work. I serve several Kenyan foods because they are much consumed by the locals here. On average the profit amount I raise per day is $10.00. With these I pay myself $7.00 salary and $3 is what I re-plough into the business translating to re-ploughed profits per month at $90.For the approximate $90, I will expand the kiosk by 2 iron sheets for $15, 5kg nails for $10, 4 pieces of timbers for $8, 20 pieces of planks for $30, $10 for labour and $3 for goods transportation. I will need to make my customers feel the comfort of my kiosk so i will buy three in one set of  hot pot for $7 and a thermo flask for $7.",0.76134671884714911,0.0,0

Am twenty one years of age turning twenty two in two months time . I grew up in Nyeri County, Kenya. Did my primary school education in 2007 and joined Ruthagati High School  the following year where I did my national examinations.I run a poultry farm. After high school I went to the city to look for employment but I was frustrated searching for employment without success.With the small savings from my high school pocket money I built a house for rearing chicken and bought 10 kienyeji indigenous chicks, that was 2012. I have over 1000 chickens yearly. As of now, I have 320 kenbros, 500 layers and 180 kienyeji chicken and  more that 260 afew days (1day - 14 days) old chicks . I hope to be the best in seller of chicken products in my region.Commercial feeds have become too expensive nowadays that you cannot survive with them if you want to make profits. Due to the government regulations that most of the products should be packed in a 50kgs bag most of the millers have used this to their advantage they have reduced their bag sizes from 70Kgs to 50kgs but we have not seen the prices go down and those who have is with less than a 1US dollar. Recently I paid and attended a seminar at KARI (Kenya Agricultural Research Institute) where the agricultural gurus as I would call them showed us on how to make the feeds using the Pearson square method, in this method the digestible crude protein is the basic nutritional requirement for any feeds preparation for all animals and birds. I learnt the crude protein content of the ingredients used in making chicken feeds noting that each stage of growth and category have different nutrition needs.From my record, I realised that 75- 80 percent of the total cost of production goes to feeds which lead me to think about making my own feeds so that I can at least lower the price of production and save. I also noted that I am not guaranteed that the feeds are of good quality and poor quality feeds may lead to slow growth of my chickens, disease or even death which even thinking of it gives me running stomach.The materials are available locally and cheaply especially the harvesting season, and depending on the cost of raw materials I can save 30-45 %. After doing enough research I concluded that I want to make this feeds. And making this feeds I would require around Kshs42,800/=. With my savings and the loan from the lenders I hope to achieve my target. Materials include:- whole maize, soya, fish meal(Omena) sunflower , Maize bran, lime as a source of calcium, cotton seed cake, bone meal and additives.Materials goes for Kshs38,000/=Transporting the materials using public means Kshs3,000/=Labour cost: - 2 personnel to help me Kshs1,800/=TOTAL COST: KSH 42,800/=THANK YOU AND WELCOME ABOARD KEVIN NYACHIHI",0.82728867542121121,0.49552841658002977,1
