The first loan that I want will be injected into this business and will produce profits and then I could cope with my commitments.Thanks to my friend, I got to know Zidisha and therefore I would like my turn to apply for a loan to boost my activity selling cooked meat. With more than 10 years in this field, I am proud of the experience I have acquired during this time. I could achieve many more things, of which I can mention the purchase of a tricycle motorcycle that allows me to travel to transport meat. This second loan which I beseech you for 171,000 francs will allow me to pay sufficiently for the meat and to save. The remaining money will allow me to redesign my little place to make it more attractive. The sum of 12500 francs will be my profits and regularly make repayment.

After staying in the hot sun for a couple of hours, i could at times end up with nothing simply because the charcoal could all bun to ashes while i am a sleep at night. 2. The forest wardens could hunt me and chase me threatening even to shoot me. 3. The prices could at times go down such that i could end up selling at a very law cost. With all this challenges i resolved to think again. I tried my luck to look for a job but due to corruption, i could not find one because i had no money to bribe. It was only when my uncle bought a p.s.v vehicle that he employed me as a conductor, he was paying me 100/- per day and 50/- for lunch. I got married and together with my intellectual wife, we saved the money going without lunch most of the times. a few month later, my uncles vehicle was auctioned  due to the fact that he bought the vehicle on loan and as a drunker, he invested the money he got in drinks forgetting that he has a loan to pay. I admired the business and dream that one day i would get one so i may make money as my uncle simply because in 0ne trip, we could net 2000 and we could go 5 to 6 trips a day. i believe i could do better than my uncle since i only drink milk. After it all, we found that we had saved 3350 and that is how we started a retail shop business. At the time of my wife's death in 2009 we had a stock of over 200,00 and 2 motorbikes. So that is how i started. I therefore hate alcohol and those taking it because 1. it made my father to forget his responsibility as the man of the house 2. It robbed me my job as a conductor.I want to expand my shop so I may serve more people therefore I want to add two more laptops and a printer.this will increase my earnings and the community around will get it more easy to get these services at door step.  I expect an increase in my earnings by 60 to 80%.",0.6502378890861481,0.81406432882078417,1

The idea came to me when i needed money to look after my grandmother who needed medical help which would have been possible if i had an income generating project. i started keeping chicken since as a young boy my mother used to rear them and i could see the potential in the business. My home has a pleasant climate for chicken rearing since i can acquire left over foodstuffs from a neighboring school.

I have grown up wanting to be an independent lady and a role model to my siblings.I started agribusiness farming 10 months ago in my home area after securing my previous loans from Zidisha. I managed to have two dairy cows and sustained my vegetable farm, where I have been getting some good harvest. Currently my farm is doing good: on the farm is a plantation of cabbages and I expect to be harvesting in early July. Having now established my vegetable farm and gotten a good market, I want to sustain the project with the earnings gotten from the farm as I venture into another income-generating project. With the three loans I have gotten on this platform, I have seen my income grow, which is being supplemented with my salary earnings as a nurse.Out of my current savings and the loan I will get here, I plan to start my own dispensing chemist [pharmacy], where I will be treating common illnesses to people within the locality. Some of these common illness are upper respiratory tract infections (since this is a tea growing zone) and malaria. I would also provide wound dressing, family planning services, immunizations and manage clinical symptoms like joint pains (especially for the elderly), headaches and abdominal discomfort.With the great name as a nurse I have earned in my community and the great confidence they have in me, I just realized that so many were taking advantage of that, having me prescribe drugs for them and sending me to the chemist in a nearby town to bring them the drugs I would prescribe to them.I have noted this to be a great opportunity, and I want now to bring these drugs closer to them and also do some baseline investigation such as blood pressure monitoring, temperature and weight before commencement of treatment.I want now to grow my passion of seeing a healthy community through managing some medical conditions and giving them health education.My sole business is to dispense drugs over the counter and see patient with clinical symptoms, on whom I can do baseline investigations before prescribing any drugs. This shall be after a charge since the clients will be required to pay some consultation fee, and this will sustain my clinic alongside the sale of drugs. Since my home is situated near a shopping center, I have acquired a room at a cost of $70 US dollars, this being a remote area. I plan to renovate the room at a cost of around $150 US dollars, since shelves will be fixed and the cost of material and labour inclusive. For a start, I require at least two digital thermometers, a weighing scale, and one blood pressure machine at a cost of around $150 US dollars, and I hope to use them for a long period without breakdown.

However, sometimes I've had a hard time since there are a lot of challenges as well. But even so, I've tried to look in a positive side, because I know dealing with human isn't an easy thing. In order to improve my work performance and myself, I believe there are still many things I have to learn, and need to strive for to become a successful entrepreneur in the future.In a growing era of personal needs and desires, income is the one of the most satisfying factor of an individuals life. Income from multiple sources is one of the most required trends of present requirements and lifestyle. People with ordinary or average income generally face a greater impact on their lives when their single source of income is challenged. It takes them a larger span of time to come down to the basics once they start suffering due to their single income source. As a result of this their physical and mental health also gets affected.My source of income is based on the following:1.Self-employment  Personal earnings by working for myself as an Computer Technician and Marketer for Cyrus Technoedge Pvt Limited of India.2.Personal Business  Personal earnings through my establishment business, Global Education Support.3.Investment  Earnings through my investment in my student hostel businessIdeal situation for making money is through the above stated ways. Generally I like to adhere to multiple sources of income so as to give away the burden of risking my earnings only through a particular source.About my business  Global Education Support Global Education Support is a company with the vision to raise funds to support universal education through scholarships, promoting entrepreneurship development, study abroad opportunities etc.Education, we all know, is the strongest tool for personal development and educated citizens are the strongest lever for long-term sustainable change in our society.

I normally sell the eggs to a broker who then resells them in Thika for a better price. I already have customers in Thika and its environs who are asking if i can be delivering the eggs daily at a higher price compared to the price they normally fetch from the farm.  Currently I  have made several trips to Thika  to deliver the products the price there is better because an egg goes for Kes 18 which is five shillings (Kes 5)  above what I get in the farm, in the farm I normally get Kes13.But commuting with public means is time involving and normally some of my eggs are broken. When I transport with a motorbike I deliver them in good condition but I incur the cost of paying for the motorbike the whole day which lowers my profit with 300, which is the cost I pay the motorbike owner.If I can purchase my motorbike i can easily deliver my products on time, save on time and reduce breakages which in return will give me more profit and expand my farm and hopefully i add another worker.In the farm in a day 180 x 13 = 2340 When i transport themIn a day 180 x 18 = 3,240A good motorbike will go for 90,000/= From my savings i have 70,000/=I am seeking a loan of 19000/= so that i can purchase the motorbikeThank you Kevin",0.73940198747912333,0.67003154821472366,0

The were Christians staunch and before I began nursery school they became priests in one of the Pentecostal churches in Kenya. Immediately we moved from our urban residence to a remote town in Norther Kenya - Maralal Samburu. This place is so remote that to date there are some people who don't wear clothes. They wrap robes. This is where I began school and did my 0-level. Due to the town's remote state, education is not taken with much seriousness. My parent's financial strength was also a challenge which made me go to not good schools, and being sent home periodically for school fees. This affected my education in the negative way.After high school I went to college and did my certificate in human resource management but it became difficult to continue with higher education due to finances. This prompted me to venture into business. I have tried my hands in various businesses. In those small businesses, I did my savings and managed to buy a Suzuki Maruti Omni minibus.I work in the transport sector using my Suzuki Maruti Omni minibus. This business is a commuter transport. In my current locality, the most common mode of transport is motorbike - taking people from the town center to their respective homes in the estates. The other not so common mode of transport is 'tuk-tuk' (forgive me, I can't remember the official name to this 3 wheeled motorbikes. The above two modes of transport encounter several challenges. The motorbikes for instance, clients/commuters fear for their safety since most riders don't driving licences and therefore not qualified to ride. A lot of accidents occur in this town due to the rogue riders all over the place.The three wheeled motorbikes also experience the same challenges. Commuters feel very much unsafe riding in these 'tuk-tuks' as well. After observing the above challenges, I came up with a more comfortable vehicle to take people to their destined places. I was the first person to come up with this idea in this town and with time it has become so popular and accepted by the society.My business is so challenging in the sense that you've got to have a comfortable vehicle that convinces your clients to board. The safety of clients is number one priority because this is what brings the difference with other modes of transport. In Kenya, operating in the commuter service one has to register with the government for tractability purposes. This proved to be a challenge at first due to the fact that other modes of transport viewed us as a threat to their business. They tried to hove us out of the market but eventually it became apparent that they could not hinder an idea whose time has come. In a good day the vehicle fetches around  30 US dollars. The costs in this business is the usual mechanical repairs such as service, and mechanical breakdowns. Services such as change of oil, filters and plugs are done quite often because the town is very dusty. I use the income/profits of this business with reinvestment in other areas. I save money for my children's education. I take education with so much seriousness because I would not want my children to miss out on it as I did.Greetings!  The front wheels of my taxi are worn out and need replacement. The terrain in my locality is not tarmacked and this makes tires wear out fast. With good tires, work will be easy and make more money to enable me finance my daughter's education. This is the number one priority in my 'to do' list.  Much regards in advance.

I started my farming business while in school, and at some point I could not afford school fees completely and had to get a means of paying for myself. The thought of deferring my studies made me feel sick and depressed, so I decided to work hard on my farm to raise my school fees. We have a unique culture, and the elders are rainmakers. They can actually decide whether it rains or not. That is still a puzzle to me, because I don't really understand how it works. Welcome to our land and you will see wonders! During my free time, I volunteer in the neighboring schools and teach mathematics, which is my best subject. I also guide and counsel bright and needy students to work hard to achieve their goals.I am a commercial, small-holder farmer. I grow vegetables on my farm and supply those to my clients, using my bicycle. The vegetables are fast-moving consumer goods and clients always come to my farm to buy fresh, high-quality produce. I chose this business because it's one of the most profitable businesses here, and it is not too capital-intensive. I generally spend about $100 on fuel for my small generator and on chemicals. My revenues, in good months, are between $150-$250. In a really good month, I make $150 in profits.

We supply live chicken to the neighbors and also eggs . Due to consistency since we started we have a stable customer base.The business is profitable because there is high demand for white meat and especially the local chicken which is what we are keeping and also the eggs which are preferred by most people.The main challenges are diseases and feed which are very expensive especially when the birds are few in number.My typical monthly cost of running the business is approximately US$300 while gross profit or income before these expenses is usually approximately US$480.I believe that the funding will come because if I get it now I will be able to buy many birds in readiness for the market.I would like boost my poultry farm in my farm.

I attended Koitoror primary school and later joined Paul Boit Boys kapkong for my secondary school education where i passed very well and proceeded to university where i did bachelors degree in Actuarial Science.During my period in secondary school I use to sell biscuits and sweets to my fellow students so i could earn pocket money for my upkeep in school. Later as i joined campus i applied for government student's loan where I used some part for my school fees and the rest to start my current business.  As soon as I received part of the loan, I purchased a printer worth $50 basing on the current exchange rate.  The business picked very well. Since the business is located around the university, printing and photocopy business is at boom. The culture of the students is very good and therefore it is a lucrative venture. I like reading, watching football and playing lawn tennis. I am good in making friends and having conversation on all aspects of life.I have one printer and a desktop computer which are operational. I offer printing services at a cost of $0.03 per page and photocopy services at a cost of $0.02 per page. I also offer typesetting services at $0.1 per page. At an average, my daily printing and typesetting revenue is approximately $10 and those from photocopying are approximately $4. In general, my weekly revenue is $98. I chose this kind of business because the environment suits it. Students do print notes as well as photocopy so the demand is high. I incur maintenance cost of $30 per month but not that frequently, business rent of $50 per month and buying stationeries at $35 per week. Keeping in mind these low expenses incurred, this translates to higher revenue which I use to pay for my school fees and reinvest into business.Since my current job is doing great. The number of customers I receive is promising. The problem is that, they request cyber service and I currently don't have. This has motivated me to bring the service to them. I will use $490 dollars to buy 4 desktop computers to start my mini-cyber. I am very positive that it will give me more revenue. By at least 30%.",0.0,0.33320222046208275,1

My hometown is riddled with poverty with most children finding it difficult to fund their education in the senior high school level. I have a strong passion for agriculture with the sole aim of raising income to support needy but brilliant students both in my school and hometown.My farm is a five hectare cashew plantation which was secured two years  ago. I have started making proceeds from two hectares of the farm.Cashew is a very important cash crop in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana. It has a high market demand and has improved the lives of various people. It is less tedious and less laborious to farm cashew as compared to other cash crops. I also purchase the cashew nuts from other farmers and sell it to cashew buying companies. Proceeds from my farm as well as profit generated from my cashew business help in augmenting my salary as a teacher. Profits made are to support needy but brilliant students in my community.  Securing any support in a form of loan can help me hire laborers to harvest the nuts especially during January to April. Part of the loan would be used to purchase cashew nuts for sale. I'm also researching into how to process the fruits as beverage. Most farmers concentrate solely on the nuts and allow the fruit to go waste.The fruit can also be incorporated into the soil as a source of organic fertilizer. With your financial support,a lot can be achieved.Late December marks the beginning of cashew harvest in my locality. Most farmers are unable to convey their cashew nuts to cashew buying companies which are normally located in town.The loan I secure will enable me raise money to buy the cashew nuts directly from the farmers and convey to the buying centers for sale.I will use 450 dollars of my loan for the purchase of the nuts, 100 dollars for transportation, 50 dollars for laborers (who will pick the nuts from my farm), 40 dollars to buy weedicide to spray my farm, 30 dollars for the purchase of sacs and the remaining 32 dollars for miscellaneous.I am highly optimistic that the yield from my farm as well as my salary can augment my business in realizing my dream.",0.0,0.5989732716950017,1

I like this business because in Daraja Mbili these  goods are in demand due to its climate, which is very cold, and to add on that due to high demand, these clothes are easy to sell hence i get good profit and that is why am still moving on.Since I joined this zidisha family,  I am capable of buying these bales without straining.  And am fairing on well because with the first loan I managed to expand my business and introduced new stock in, I decided to buy new shoes and ladies handbags because customers were asking for them.I buy stock every week a bale of Bedsheet costs $190, a bale of duvets costs $170 and abale of jacket I buy at $90.  In total I make a profit of $50.I bought a few shoes and handbags and I would wish zidisha to help me again add more to meet the demand in the market.Each bag costs me $15 and most shoes range between $8 to $10. And I buy them from Uganda Kampala. Because Kampala is far I would like to buy good stock that can take two to three weeks  before traveling back to Kampala. The profit  margin is between $5 to $6 per  shoes and $8 to $9 per handbag. The profit I get from second hand clothes I use part of it to take care of my family in buying food, clothes and also taking care of my needy people and the rest I use to add stock on a weekly basis.I would like  to buy shoes and ladies handbags, and add more stock for the second hand clothes atleast add one more bale.The cost of shoes range between $8 to $10 and ladies handbags range between $12 to $15 since they are of different designs.This will me good profit and change my lifestyle. It will also create job opportunity to others like the people who help me in transportation and also people who helps me  in selling moreso during market days when customers are many.My profit will increase  from $50 to $75 that's for both selling shoes and handbags and second hand clothes.",0.58588430955553716,0.75052029742743032,1

Currently I lead a group of women of about 100 in number. I identified these women from the north who currently reside in the town I am and are considered vunerable. These women either have their husbands dead or have broken homes. These women are then left with children to cater for but rather find it dificult to care for them. I therefore teach these women various things like soap making, detergents and the like. This gives them a job to earn some money to care for the family.

I went to primary and later secondary school and I always knew that if given the chance to break free, I would most certainly jump at that opportunity.  This opportunity came after finishing my secondary education when I went to live with my sister in Mombasa  800 kilometers from home.  My life took a drastic change in Mombasa city where I was exposed to the comforts of urban life like tap water and electricity for the first time.My sister was kind enough to sponsor me to a computer college where I did a short course in computer applications.  I later got a job as a computer operator after finishing the course.  While still working, I enrolled for a Diploma course in Business Management on part-time basis. I secured another job after completing my Diploma course where I was employed as a Personal Assistant in a printing firm.

Apart from cyber services, I also offer photocopying and typing services.  All these activities combined give me a gross income of about $500 per month and the expenses gobble about half of that.  I use the take home amount for my upkeep and send some to my aging my parents back home.This figure can easily go up if I introduce more services like lamination and book binding.For this reason, I decided to seek credit services hence the reason for joining Zidisha.I have been using used computer terminals in my business.

My husband works as a driver of urban transportation. I have a shop that sells a wide variety of grocery store I was in front of the village highway Tino District of Tarowang Jeneponto. Three years ago I built my house and used the front of my house as a shop. I set up the initial capital for the shop by making cakes to sell  from my own home. I then saved the profit from that as capital to purchase retail goods. Little by little I bought stocks to complete the store and now I have a lot of inventor. My retail store now is bustling with buyers since my shopis  adjacent to schools, health centers and village offices. Everyday school children come to my store. In addition to retails goods, I also sell office and school supplies such as pens, notebook, pencils, paper etc. I bought this mixture of wholesale goods from supplier cars passing my shop on the highway. I was also given a refrigerator by the company that produces softdrinks. I have three units of refrigerators from different companies. My revenue in one day is around $50 with a net profit of between $ 5 to $ 8 / day or about $ 60 / week. Since there is increase in the price of fuel oil in Indonesia all kinds of goods prices rose about 30% so that the procurement of goods in stores becomes limited. The initial plan would try to borrow capital from the local Co-op but my husband forbids because the interest is 20% for a period of only 2 months or 8-week. We can only pay the interest from our profit. Finally I got the info about Zidhisa and receive an email invitation from Guntur Ade Putra to become members Zidhisa in obtaining venture capital loans online that provide loans to the rest of the world, including Indonesia with very easy and has a lot to enjoy this loan to increase its business. I also have a hope of getting a loan like this. Loan I need is not too much for fear of not being able to pay it. So now I only need $ 150 just fit my ability to pay back to Zidhisa. Request for a loan like that I will be able to pay with 15% interest per year.I have paid up my second loan without any hurdle. My second loan payment was ahead of the payment schedule. I had deliberately asked for loan with small payment amount with longer time frame just in case something happened (ed. she had wanted to pay up earlier than the schedule anyway).  If my revenue increase, I can then afford more loan repayment amount. After my second loan, my revenue experienced day-to-day increase. I hope my revenue will keep going up.For this third loan, I want to focus on packaged drinking water. The demand for this will increase due to prolonged draught. The profit margin for selling packaged drinking water is around 25% or 3 times more than that if the cashflow that will be generated from my loan can flow through 3-5 times throughout the loan repayment period (ed. she's making a prediction that from this third loan she is very certain that she can manage her cashflow very well as if she is borrowing 3 or 5 times more money for her business).I hope that this third loan can be funded quick, and I also hope that I can repay all the loan easily like before. I am committed to keep being a good member of Zidisha and become an example for other borrowers.On this third loan, I focus on the procurement of Bottled Drinking Water as 1000 boxes for a price of IDR10.267.000. Bottled water demand is very high because in Indonesia, especially the area where I live has a wave of prolonged drought, so that people had trouble getting clean water for consumption. The dry season is called El Nino and it has been anticipated that rain will begin to fall in November. Hopefully my third loan will be still given the opportunity and the confidence from the lenders.",0.61957615177351499,0.55676784684959857,0

I have a small cyber cafe in Kiambogo Location, Elementaita Division, Gilgil Sub-county.  I have a Bsc in Environmental & Biosystems Engineering and I majored in Water & Irrigation Engineering. I am married to one wife and have a daughter who is three years old. I have worked as a Production Engineer at Milimani Bottlers for a period of one year. I then ventured into business and opened an mpesa in shauri moyo area in Nairobi after which i relocated back to my home where I so the opportunuty to open a cyber cafe since printing and photocopying services were not offered in the area. I was brought in a family of businessmen as my father was a shopkeeper and I had a dream of opening my own business in future. I have done business for three years now and I can attest that business is the way to go.  Besides business I have ventured into farming though on a small scale. Primarily, I do business and I love computers.  There is nothing that brings me pleasure than doing the work that i love.After completing my undergraduate studies I had one computer which I was using while in school.  when the opportunity to start a cyber cafe presented itself I talked to a friend who had a desktop computer that had a blown up power supply and he gave it to me free of charge. I repaired the computer and together with my own i had two computers.  I then had some money from my savings and I used it to buy a printer and rent the premise for my business. After a couple of months I bought one more computer and I had three fully functional computers. I worked for a few more months and bought the fourth computer and a laminator. Within one and half year I had achieved all these. The people owithin this area are from different ethnic groups, majorly the Kikuyu, Maasai and Kalenjin. The main economic activity is farming where maiza and beans are the dominant crops.My business is mainly a service industry. I offer type setting, photocopying, printing and internet services.  My business is stratergically placed as am close to the administration offices where my services are on high demand from the members of the public seeking services from the offices. The reason i chose this business is because since High School I was fond of computers and also the operating cost of the business is low. The main costs are from power, materials like printing papers and rent. The profit I generate from the business is reinvested to grow the business. I also support my family as my parents are subsistent farmers. I am planning to expand the business by opening a photo studio as well as offer photo printing service in the near future as the service are not offered in the area am located. My dream is to offer competitive services to the people within my locality.I am planning to purchase an Epson T50 stylus Photo printer that can print photos, wedding cards, greeting cards, calendars as well as business cards. The printer costs about $320.  I am planning also to open a photo studio once I acquire the printer and this will mean more revenue hence increased profit.  Photography is an untapped area within the region and I believe with the acquisition of a printer with the capabilities of printing photos I will really grow my business. If i buy the printer it will increase my profits by about 40% - 50% since I will it will be doing a lot of work in terms of photo printing as there is no one around this area who prints photos.",0.26004738279227801,0.79434819357406472,0

I have planned on buying an electric sewing machine to help make my work go easier and quicker which would make me sew more than usual.

This is because, sometimes I spend lots of time on few sewing and if there was additional machine and someone to help then work would have been quicker and easier for me. It will also help my business to grow faster and my discount rate to grow as compared to the percentage I have made so far without workers. I expect my profit discount to move to at least 10% or more. I hope I will be granted the loan and do with it as I have planned, thank you !",0.57898936959526115,0.76449848235071416,1

I live in Milimani, Juja, which is located in Kiambu County. I believe that I possess several qualities which make me uniquely qualified to contribute to the community. My educational background, which combines general knowledge with accounting, affords me an uncommon perspective on business.I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Administration at Kenyatta University in my final year. I also hold a Certified Public Accountant (Part II) and I am an aggressive business lady. My background in the complementary areas of business and accounting gives me a special perspective which I will pass to my fellow countrymen.I currently run my own business called NOMKUNGU BOOKSTORE that provides high school, universities and college students with the opportunity to buy, sell and trade used textbooks and school supplies. My business generates approximately $600 as net profit monthly. In a nutshell, I am an aggressive young lady whose intention is to make money and also assist others.My company, which is solely owned, deals with secondhand books and started in the year 2011. My companys name is called NOMKUNGU SECONDHAND BOOKSTORE and is a store providing high school, universities and college students with the opportunity to buy, sell and trade used textbooks and school supplies. In addition to textbooks, students may sell their school supplies like class notes, old newspapers, laptops, accessories or anything that they wish to sell or buy in my store. I used my own book collections as start-up inventory base. In addition, I talked to neighbors, friends and relatives, who donated some of the books. After making these rounds, I managed to get 4,000 books as start-up stock when I opened up for business. My companys goal is to strive to achieve the following:1)Become the leading secondhand book seller in Kenya2)Attract 500,000 customers in the next five years3)Achieve the target of 50,000 visits per month4)Establish sustainable profitability within the first five yearsMy company carries a broad and varied inventory of high school, university and college secondhand textbooks and other materials at all price levels and provides services to help students succeed academically and in an affordable manner. NOMKUNGU SECONDHAND BOOKSTORE generates profitable revenues equal to or exceeding national norms while keeping the cost of retail items competitive for high school, university and college students, and campus community members. I constantly seek to improve my interactions with customers and have invested a lot of time and resources in the business.Operating a used book store is a like owning a recycling center: it is not too glamorous but very profitable. My company generates almost $6,700 per year as net profit. I buy old textbooks averagely at $2 and sell them averagely for $5, therefore making an average profit of $3 per textbook. In addition, school supplies like class notes, old newspapers, laptops, accessories make a profit of $100 per month.I need a loan so as to maintain and increase my businesss current inventory. After receiving the loan last time, I managed to source a specialized point-of-sale system software that has facilitated easy categorization on inventories of used books. This has boosted my business and has definitely increased my profit since I am now able to manage my revenue.Being January, many parents are taking their children to school and most university students are going back to campus. Since it is a high season for my business, I need a loan to acquire more inventories of used books. I receive approximately 30% to 35% of the buying value after selling the books. After receiving the loan, I intend to add more used books, each retailing at an average of 2 dollars, since it is the high season. This will add additional revenue of approximately 2,500 dollars per month. Please fund me, Zidisha.",0.70501353115589893,0.0,0

I am an ambitious youth who wishes to suceed with breeding birds and also wishes to farm.With 25 000 CFA ($50) I would like to sell chickens. I think that in this country in crisis only food really works. Customers will prefer my business (chicken) because my product isnt expensive. The risks are poultry diseases. With my loan I will buy 15 chicks for 7500 CFA (500 CFA per chick) and the chicken feed for 15 000 CFA. With the 2500 leftover I will buy medicine to take care of the chicks. Production will last 45 days after which theyll weigh 1.5kg and each chicken will be worth 2500 CFA, this means that 15 chicks*2500=37 500 CFA ($75).Dear Lenders, Hello! I present to you my third project with Zidisha. I will continue to sell chickens. But I have continued to enlarge my ideas. With my third loan 142,840 XOF (246.05 USD), I can buy 50 chicks at 25,000 XOF ( 43.06 USD), 4 sacks of food at 60,000 XOF (103.35 USD), medicine for the chicks 10,000 XOF ( 17.23 USD), and the mulch and the transportation for materials 7,500 XOF ( 12.92 USD). This totals 102,500 XOF (176.56 USD). There remains 40,340 XOF (69.49 USD). I wish to make an egg incubator. I have a small, broken refrigerator I can modify to have an egg incubator. A friend he will ask 20,000 XOF (34.45 USD) and the incubator can hold up to 50 eggs or more. And after that, I will have more experience! And the 20,000XOF (34.56 USD) that remains, I can repair my broken freezer. Thanks in advance for your help! Ameth",0.46238495114727712,0.83263825439400674,0

Besides school am an entrepreneur running two micro businesses one being rearing of broiler chicken and selling of clothes  when i was starting this business partly of the capital came from my family members and some i generated from engaging myself from odd jobs which i did during the weekends.my motivation was my mum who got a road accident and lost wan of her leg when i was in school so my fees became a major problem i had to work hard to provide fees and help her where i could.,but by the Grace of God and the help of zidisha loans i have overcome all thatI am a role model to other young people in my community and university as most of them have been visiting my business.Besides working am involved with an organization by the name kibera infortaners situated in kibera slum where we mentor children and engage them in educational and motivational talks and activities.I also enjoy traveling ,socializing and making new friends...Am an entrepreneur lady where by  i have a great passion for business which i study at my degree level at K.C.A University.I own two businesses one being selling of new clothes that is mens and ladies trousers,dresses,men and ladies shirts, African attires e.g.sandals.I target mostly the students because according to my research are fashion icons and buy clothes oftenly according to new trends int he market.By getting the third zidisha loan i was able to add a variety of clothes that i was not selling e.g shoes,curtains,and African vitenges and African attires and also by the Gods grace i got several customers who i got to supply new clothes at a wholesale price thus include vitenge and African wrappers(leso in swahili).I maintain my customers by keeping a good customer care relation,asking for their opinions and getting to know what the want,and by providing an affordable price.Challenges that i face are sometimes prices in wholesale go up due to economic instability and changing my prices becomes an inconvenience.My second business is rearing of broiler chicken which i have increased to an amount of 350 chicks which are 2 weeks old and going to ready for sale in the next 6 weeks.My clothes business total income is has increased from 527 dollars to 720 dollars,hence the total expenses  has increased from236 dollars to 315dollars thus my profit being 405 dollars .by the help of the previous loan i have been able to increase the number of chicks i rear to 350 chicks which i kept one and half weeks weeks ago and are due for sale in the next 4 and a half weeks due to climate change a few to an amount of 10 chicks did not survive thus the total chicks being 340..thus my profit of both clothes and rearing chicks has greatly increased..the profit of broiler chicken is 345.18 dollars this because one chicken has a profit of  1.02 dollars thus 340*1.02.With the help of the loan i will am planning to buy a deep freezer at a price of 304.57 this is for storing the chicken meat after it has been slaughtered,,second planning to rent the premises at 101.52 dollars per month plus a deposit of the same amount to rent 101.52 dollars thus the total being 203.04 dollars,am also planning to add  100 layers chicks where buy one costs 1.02 dollars thus the total being 101.52 dollars to purchase them then add the food expenses to 255.84 dollars a month  add to my savings to sustain then up to the time they start laying eggs..when i manage to put up the fast food my profit for chicken will increase to 1.02 dollars per chicken this is because at wholesale price i sell at 3.55 dollars each while the retail that is in fast foods or restaurant are sold from 4.57 dollars. A benefit of opening a fast food is that marketing of the chicken will be no longer a problem because sometimes we lack buyers when the chicken meat is a lot in the market thus i will be able to sell directly to the consumer and at a higher price than the wholesale price.",0.73280037166623735,0.78200660743410133,0

For the last 15 years I have been working in Langas slum village, Pioneer Location , Uasin Gishu County,where I run a church among very poor slum dwellers.Having seen the desperate situation in which many family live, I was moved with lot s of compassion towards the many Orphans and vulnerable children who could not afford going to school due to extreme poverty and lack of school uniform and food. It is on this platform that I came up with Christian Hope community based Organization to address the desperate need in the slums children. For the last 10 years we have been supporting 30 orphans and vulnerable children.To support this endeavor, we have been getting support from the Church well-wishers and  from the community. Due to high demand of our support,I had to come up with a  Green House project.So far we have established one of such green house.Since  we are planning to double the intake for such needy children.  We would therefore wish to construct at least three Green Houses before the end of 2015.This will help us raise enough resources to support these needy children, instead of depending on external funding and support which are a bit challenging to get currently. Due to the unpredictable weather pattern, there are season when tomatoes and green vegetable are very scarce and the demand becomes very high and the prices are so good.Green house is currently becoming the only best option for food security especially in boosting horticultural production. We are also using this project for the purpose of training the older youths from the slum to be future users of this technology.With the availability of ready market this projects is so viable due to the ever increasing urban population in Eldoret and other urban centers around.We would wish to usher many into this project and also to market Zidisha micro loan to expand its domain, not only in Eldoret but also in other parts of Western Kenya where I have other Church branches.GREEN HOUSE PROJECT FOR TOMATOES PRODUCTION:-This project program is geared towards offering support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children leaving in Langas Slums. This is part of our community support program which have been running for the last 10 years. We have been  fully depending on donation from Church and other donation from well-wishers from around the project area.To enhance long term support program we have started a greenhouse project to boost income towards this program.With the help of Zidisha loan we will be able to expand this project by constructing another green House.The cost of a complete green house is K.shs 150,000.This is the cost of constructing a complete Green House measuring (60 X 8 Mtres)Which breakdown is as follows:-1.Posts, Polls and Truces (lamb some)  @Ksh.25, 000 =US $ 250.2.100Kgs of greenhouse Sheet @ 200 per/kg =Ksh20,000 =US$2003.Tomatoes seed ( one Packet ) @ 5000 Each=K.sh5,000  =US$ 504.Labor = Ksh20, 000  =US$  2005.Drips (Lamp some) @ K.Shs.6000 =US$  606.1500 Water Tank @Kshs. 14,000  =US$ 1407.Water Pump @ K.shs  25,000 = US$ 2508.Technical support @ 10000 Per monthx3 months=30000=US$ 3009.Contingencies @  K.Shs5,000  =US$ 100SUB-TOTALK.SHS.150,000 = US$.1500We shall be able to produce approximately Kshs.5000 Kgs of tomatoes from our 1st Green House harvest which shall be sold @ Kshs 50 per kg which is equals to 250,000 which is approx.US$ 2500.We shall then put back K.shs 145,000 into the new Greenhouse while the rest will go toward our Support program for Orphans and to repay our 1st loan.

I did My primary education and part of my secondary education in the same town Lusaka,after my school leaving examination i went for the compulsory military  training in another town.After the military training i went to college to study Meteorology for two years and when i graduated i joined the ministry of of transport and communication Meteorological department where i worked for 32 years and retired in 2014.I am at the moment waiting for my retirement benefits and while am waiting for the retirement benefits iam running a small business selling groceries .My bussiness i am undertaking is a small shop in the market i buy groceries at whole sale price and i sale at retail price.The shop i own i sale the following items sugar,salt ,detergents, soft drinks, bread, eggs,sweets,candles,fish,beans scones, jam and many other items.I get my deliveries from different suppliers some traders bring their items and i buy at whole sale price while for other items i do travel to other towns in order to get my supplies.I have a lot of customers who come to buy from the shop the business does very well at the month end as most of my customers come to buy cash and when they dont have cash i do give goods to my customers goods on credit and they pay when they are paid.I do keep broiler chickens which i also sale to my customers and i also deliver to other customers who make orders.I conclude by saying the shop sales are very good and have assisted me to pay school fees for my daughter who is doing a three years teacher training course and also pay for school fees for my son who is doing grade nine.I intend to expand my business so that i will be able to send my second born child to college using profits realized from the business.I chose to deal in retail shop due to where i stay its 10 Kms from town and most of the customers find it expensive to go and buy items in town.My costs of doing business are not very high as at the moment i spend about K2000 Kwacha to buy items and after the sales i do remain with a profit of K300 per month.The service and goods i provide to my customers are useful to my customers because my customers save on money and time instead of going into town are able to get the items locally.When iam given the loan i will increase the amount of goods i do sale in the shop example i do buy 25 Kg of flour,20 kg of sugar , I will increase the amounts to double as these items are on high demand.the benefits i will get as i increase the amounts of goods i  order is i will spend less on transport costs as there will be no need of me going to town to buy twice in a moth.I expect to get a profit of K500 per month if i increase the amount of goods to sold in the shop.",0.3312774051046844,0.0,1

I love Art same as Technology. My hobbies led me to who i am today as one of my ambitions has always been 'how  can i make money from what i love doing'. Having read most of successful business ideas have always germinated from what proprietors had passionate about from scratch.Well, in that case,I developed interest in Graphic Design and Music and found my own ways of mastering the two arts while still in School. Immediately after School in 2011, i started  Abriels Corporate Element;an advanced Graphic & Design company offering computer graphic services and bulk printing for corporates.You can read more about me in Wikipedia - (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chrispuspeter)Abriels Corporate Element started in 2011 and was registered as a company in 2012. Back then it was just a graphic studio with one computer and a HP Deskjet Printer as i can recall. Within a span of  those few years,  Abriels has grown to be a brand on her own and diversified her wings to offering other services that still align to my all times ambition, "" Making Money from What i Love doing"".Apart from Graphic Design, the company is  curently offering Web Design services, Branding and Signage, Professional Photography, Audio Recording and Music Production. We now have 3 studio, Graphic Studio,Photography Studio and Recording Studio sections. The company has created employment for 5 people; 3 permanent staff and  two on commission. Each section runs independently and has other brands besides it, such  as the the Mizizi Radio , an Online Radio Station under Abriels Recording Studio that plays music producesd from our studio. We also have Semanami Supermodels under Abriels Photography Section. Abriels Graphic section is now offering graphic design services for Binare International and you can check some of our design jobs by downloading  the binare company profile at www.binare.net ( http://www.binare.net/downloads/BINARE_KE_14-1.pdf)However the company has a common account despite having separate books of accounts and the services offered in each section generates revenue for the company that caters for staff salary and monthly bills that totals to about  US$ 500 -  600 Per Month.  Since we started the recording studio we have been having several enquiry about offering Music lessons and am seeing that as another opportunity and another job for one of the jobless youth out there. Am embarking on a plan to introduce a music school under the Abriels Recording Section before the end of this year.The previous Zidisha Loan helped me setup the school within the Recording Studios and also Launched DJ Academy. With this Loan, i will use it to expand the School . Currently, we are using AFX Studio 2 as a classroom but Id like to separate the Music School and DJ Academy from the Recording Studios to a separate room away from disrupts of producers and recording artists passing through the classroom to access Studio 3( See photos in my album or check on our facebook page (/Abrielsfx).With the Loan,I will pay the rental fee for that  extra room and pay all bills that comes along with  before occupying any office, and the remainder ill buy few more chairs and learning material like song books and tutorials for the school. The young boys and girls are now depending on us to make their musical career come true that why we need support from you guys to make them realize their dreams. So my lenders, lets build Abriels School of Music together and  Its  on your contribution that will make the aspiring artists and musicians to one day, put a bread on their table through their passion of Music.

I have been employed for many years in the private sector but in all those years, I longed to go it alone and start my own business. in 2008 I finally worked on a way of going into business and do what I know best, i.e computer services, internet and graphics.  In 2011, I rented a cheap business premise in Machakos town.  I started with a computer and a printer.  I managed to buy a photocopier, another computer and other small machines.  This is my fifth year in business.  I have gone through lots of ups and downs in business like dealing with  different kinds of customers with different attitudes, some may be harsh and unfriendly, others are perfectionists, others are very mean etc.I also have very good customers who consistently give me business, and i have seen the business clientelle and profits grow.  Ive been a temperamental person, but the business has changed me to a controlled person, able to bear with different people, control my moods to accommodate all.  I have also learnt about financial management.  This year, i am working out of a way of opening another business branch with concentration on a stationery shop.My business started in 2011.  I started with one computer, a printer, and a camera.  I used to do computer services like typing, online services, computer trainings, taking & production of photos & photocopying.The services offered are:Typing, Printing, Photocopy, Scanning, Lamination, Binding, photography, making & printing of certificates , making of students cards  online services like Ghris, KRA, emails, both opening of accounts and teaching, mobile phone charging, selling of stationeryPhotographic: its my best business at the moment.  Its very quick service with low costs but a good profit.Printing:  Normally we print after typing or saved information in flash disks, or we download from the internet.  This is also another profitable service.  We charge 10 for every page printed, and sometimes we can print up to 50 pages in a day giving 500/-. Internet services:  We charge according to the time spent.  The minimum amount being 10/-.  There are several online services required like production of payslips for civil servants, teachers, opening of e-mail accounts , production of pin & tax certificates, downloading needed information, etcScanning, Lamination & Binding.This are one time jobs.  They are not daily jobs, but they have good profits.  E.g scanning of 1 document is 30/-.Lamination uses abit of electricity.  We charge 50/- per copy, and the profit made is about 30/-.Binding charges depend on the volumes and the profit is minimal.On a normal day, I make a profit of about 800/-.  This is not constant as in other days I can make a profit of over 2000/-. It varies between those rangesChallengesI mostly depend on electricity for 99% of my work.  When theres no electricity, or frequent power blackouts, I am out of business. Prices change.  Sometimes the prices of stock goes up & down.  When up, we are not able to increase the prices as customers diminishes, so we are forced to stick to the normal prices to avoid losing customer and we therefore get lesser profits.Current challengesI need to buy a laptop so that i can be working from the house.If am given the loan, i will buy a laptop which will cost appx.

Though I had problems financing my education in 2007.God was still faithful to me that I graduated my senior high school with excellent grades but I had no funds to continue my education to the tertiary level.For this reason I needed to wait for some years before I could continue with the hope that I will be able to get some funds to see me through my education.As I patiently wait for the hope of entering the university, I started my wood and logs business which has kept me going through. I have been running this business for some time now and it has been very fruitful with the help I receive from Zidisha.At the moment, am enrolled in the University of Ghana, studying dietetics but still happily managing my wood business because it has been my source of income for my education.

This means averagely am able to sell 1500 slates of processed woods to the communities and contractors.Each slate of wood cost 2.50 dollars (10 Ghana cedis) which means I make a sale of 3,750.00 dollars when 1500 pieces of the slates are sold in the week and an average of 15,000.00 dollars monthly.Money gained after the expenses are deducted is used in financing my university and also reinvesting into the business as I receive some help from the loan I receive from Zidisha.

Examinations sap things of us. They are an evil dream for us. Examinations make us to shudder and to fear for failure makes us unhappy. The desire to play as well as the tempting to enjoy seems to lose our intensity as soon as we think of examination.Before the examination, we have to suspend all the pleasure giving activities. We talk about books and questions and discuss about answering those questions. We will make many plans which we would implement after the examinations. The lomo guys perch on trees to learn, Simon and co will be learning in the toilets, Adu and Annor will be running to the campus to hide in the classrooms to learn, the ladies will then be running helter scatter for these guys to help them with discussions. I would sit in the room with doors all shut down but still will hear sound from the silence.The night before the examination is a terrible night. One dreams of questions and the question papers. In the morning, even Bruce and Simon who do not believe in God pray in front of the examination hall. One feels that everything has evaporated from their brain. One student will muse, this question is sure shot, another would ask, have you prepared these questions?. The beating of the heart increases as we enter the examination hall.In the examination hall we pray to God or revised our questions. If the question paper is difficult, sachet of water is ordered. The candidate perspires. If it is easy, we start writing and feel happy in solving the questions. But in this case also, we really become unhappy because we fail short of time to finish our papers.After the examination the sorrows stick to us. We talk to our friends, I was a bit confused or I could not finish the paper. Even after all the tests are over we dont feel satisfied. We count our marks daily and think that we will get a second class. In this manner, the dooms day  when the results is to be announced. We try to find our roll numbers on the notice board. If it is missing, we have to be the taunting remarks of our neighbours, friends and relatives. In case we get through, we are never satisfied with the marks we have secured. We will often be heard saying, There is something wrong with the examiner. Perhaps my paper has been changed. So sorrow and examination go side by side. Rather Examination means sorrows.I sell mobile phone credit cards, EVD(credit transfer), mobile phone accessories and I also do Mobile money transfer.  Today, you can't do almost anything without the mobile phone. It is now use in many ways today, in communication, in sending, searching, receiving information and a lot more. In doing all these stuffs, you have to fuel your phone. The fuel for the phone is it's credit. I chose this kind of business because in my area or community its difficult for one to get credit to buy. One has to walk for about 3 or 4 kilometers before getting credit to buy. I also chose it because so long as cell phones, internet and other electronic device activities are concerned, demand for their fuel (credit) will always increase. It cost me about $1282.00 to establish my business. It was a gradual process. It took about 9months to construct the structure of about $435.00I started with the credit cards and the EVD and later attached the phone accessories and the mobile  money transfer.  Everyday, I make a profit of about $9-10. That's about  $270-300 per month. About  one-third of the profit is use for reinvesting in the business, one-third goes my education and the other one-third goes into savings.I have been operating Mobile Money Banking for the past six months. I have been operating it with an amount of about $420. Since I started, there have been a lot of pressure on me. I have little fun to meet the demands. I have to go to town two or three times a day  for 'e-cash' or physical cash. 'E-cash'(E.C) is the balance of money on the phone and Physical Cash (P.C) is the money in hand. When the E.C is low that i can not  transfer money to a customer's wallet, l would have to rush to the township which is about 3/4km away to top up. On the other hand, when the P.C is finished, I would have to travel the same distance. I am therefore going to invest the loan if giving me to at least meet some level of demand. I always want to help my clients/customers. Sometimes, it is painful to receive a customer and cannot render their services. I believe and hope by the help of zidisha and my grateful lenders,  gradually, gradually I will meet if not all a high level of demand.",0.47228441253052772,0.270758497650184,1

I grew up in a very challenging situation under the care of my stepmother, after my parents divorced when I was only three years old.I have always been willing to help vulnerable children because I really understand what they go through. I have been a guardian for two orphans, brothers, who lost their parents more than 10 years ago, and they are very bright and willing to fulfill their dreams in life. The eldest is in his 4th year at Muranga University (JKUAT) pursuing B-COM. Samuel had dropped out of form one when I took him, and his brother Godfrey had joined street boys in Eldoret after dropping out of school in class four, as he had already given up in life because he had nowhere to turn to. To prove the world wrong, he was the top student on the KCPE exams in Gombe primary school with 365 points.I am requesting for a second loan to expand my poultry farming in the village. My biggest challenge is to fence my compound [and] clear Samuel's final examination fees, which are due later this month.I have been employed with the Institute for Security Studies since May 2008 and I am planing to repay my loans through my salary as I continue to grow my business. I also run a small poultry farm business in the village in Siaya County: it's still in its early stages, but I have high hopes it will grow rapidly with the help of Zidisha.I am planning to fence the whole compound, which is already in the process. I had purchased a few chickens, wire mesh, and poles for fencing the whole compound to enable me focus on this business, as I have already done my research and I believe it can generate good return if managed well.I am also thinking in other areas of investments like dairy farming, which needs enough capital to start, but I believe that a journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step and that is the step I have already taken.I have high hopes that I will succeed and this gives me faith that it will not be difficult for me to manage school fees for one of the orphans (Godfrey). Samuel is waiting to graduate in November. All this was possible with the help of my first loan from Zidisha. Big up to Zidisha team. I grew up in a very difficult environment and I am willing to help the orphans as much as I can.I am planning to invest this amount in poultry farming, which is already in the process but has had challenges like diseases. That is why I am planning to fence in the whole compound to reduce the risk. The business alone will pay for Godfrey's school fees.

I studied my primary education in a local school then after passing my examinations was admitted to high school. Thought my high school I had a passion in computers. I took computer studies as my technical subject of which I passed well in my KCSE exams. I managed to secure an admission to join a public university through a regular programme. Being in the university opened up my mind, having friends and company of business minded people. This saw me to coming up with several business ideas that I could do in order to sustain my school life. In my 1st year I used to deliver food to students' hostels at a small fee, this was my first experience in business. And after being in the business for a while I was able to gain more knowledge on the dos and donts in business, how to attract more customers, branding and how to retain customers. Later in my second year I managed to start a cyber cafe around the school, this was possible through the savings that I had accumulated from my first business. What I can say is that the journey has not been smooth, sometimes I found myself running at a loss. An example is when there were few customers that could not even make you pay the bills. So occasionally I had to inject a few coins to sustain the business running. What's interesting in this country is the passion that the youth have towards their financial success, and how their dreams drive them to fight harder to make it a reality. One of my hobbies is going through the internet learning new things, this has made me to widen my scope to seeing the future on an international level.After my first business I decided to venture into a new business and test my creative strength and ability to make a reality out of a dream. What drove me into deciding to start a cyber cafe was the demand for students in the university to do online research, print their work, connect to friends and other students from all over. I realised that it would be a very lucrative business and I would have helped solve a problem. Since the students crowd in the few cafes that are available and thus cannot do their work peacefully and conviniently. Another major reason why I chose the business is because of the capital that I needed in order to start.  The savings that I had was enough to rent a space and buy few computers to start.  At first I had three client computers. As the business progressed I was able to purchase a small printer. This helped increase the services that I could offer to the clients. I was now able to offer internet access and printing services. What keeps my customers coming back is the competitive rates that I offer. They are so low that they attract more customers yet more to keep the business running as still keep some as savings. My current objective is to keep reinvesting in the business by buying more computers, chairs and a bigger printer. This will help grow my business. And after being introduced to zidisha by a friend I realised that their aim was to boost small entrepreneurs andI could grow my business at a faster rate. I decided that it was the next step for my business. The loan will help me acquire more equipments thus translating to a bigger business.I thank Zidisha for the loan I was previously awarded. It helped me accomplish my desires for the business. When awarded the new loan I would like to increase the speeds of my internet connections. I would also like to expand the services I offer from photocopying, scanning and internet connection to include lamination and binding. The budget for this is as below. Improving my bandwidth-$100Laminating machine-$ 50Binding machine- $30Maintenance of existing equipment and painting- $20. These adds up to a total of100+50+30+20: 200 dollars.When I have been able to acquire the equipments and improve my internet connectivity. My profits will increase. From the lamination with an approximate of 100 laminating works @ sh50 per task totals to sh5000 per month. Assuming the operating cost is sh2500 this brings the profit to sh2500 which is 100%.. With the binding machine and 50 binding works per month @sh60 per task totals to sh3000. If the operating cost is sh1500, the net profit is  1500 which is 50%. The improved internet speeds will attract more customers and help market the other services. When granted the loan I will be able to offer more services which is reliable and help bring them closer to the students. Thanks for the help already granted before.",0.71685824385170105,0.5896725906432092,0

I would not have been able to go to high school but for the fact that i won a scholarship after emerging first in my school in the Basic Education Certificate Examination i sat for in the year 2001. I entered high school on the 8th of September, 2001 and successfully completed on the 4th of July, 2004 aged eighteen (18). The high cost of university education in the country prevented me from going to the university the following year. In March 2005, i had a teaching teaching appointment in private school in Sankore where i had my basic education. i quit after just three months to take up another teaching appointment at the Ghana Education Service as the salary was much better there than what i was paid at the private school. I spent close to three years with the Ghana Education Service and again quit to accept an admission offer to pursue a diploma in basic education programme at the St. Joseph's College of Education at Bechem in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana. I successfully passed out in 2011 and have since been engaged by the Ghana Education Service as a classroom teacher. I teach at a junior high school in a village called Adomakokrom located a little over two kilometres east of Goaso where i reside. Majority of folks here are farmers while a few are into petty trade. Traditional food crops like cassava, plantain, yam, cocoyam and sweet potato are cultivated on subsistence basis. The fertile nature of the land also allows for the cultivation of vegetables like cabbage, lettuce, carrot, pepper tomatoes and garden eggs. My children have big dreams: some of them want to be lawyers, others teachers, doctors, engineers while some want to auto mechanics seamsters/seamstresses etc. The journey to where i am now hasn't been an easy one, a very difficult one i must say.I have a private school i started three years ago. The school runs on part-time basis. The subjects taught in my school are English Language, mathematics, integrated science and information and communication technology. These are all core subjects taught in junior high schools in Ghana. Pupils must pass examination in all these subjects at the 9th grade to be able to go to high school. Three years ago, two parents hired me to teach their 9th graders all the aforementioned subjects as they prepared themselves towards their final examination. The children performed very well in the examination they sat for. Recommendations of their parents led to other parents needing my services. I now have twenty-five pupils in my private school. I meet them in a structure i have constructed on all the weeek days after they close from their regular school session. Each child pays 1GHS  a day to partake in lessons. Out of the fee i charge, i buy chalk, reference materials for my use during lessons, and supplementary readers to help my pupils learn to read better. The profit i make from my school business helps me pay the fees of my younger brother at the university. I am happy with the impact my business is making in the lives of these children. I can only look forward to seeing these children pass their final examination and there after achieve their individual life goals.Many of the pupils i teach can't read well largely because they do not have reading materials to use for practice at home. I would therefore use the money to buy library books and other supplementary readers  for them(pupils) . This will offer them an opportunity to practise reading at home which i think will eventually help them (pupils) become better readers. This will also help me give them the preparation they need to pass their final examination. The success of the pupils in their final examination will draw a lot more pupils to enrol in my part-time school. This will surely help me increase my profit.",0.0,0.39269439129103928,0

December 1980. I grew up in the village under the care of my grandmother. Having my old grandma as my guardian angel at that young age really prepared me for the life that was ahead of me. At the age of nine years and in class three, I had started to learn how to be independent.I always looked at my grandmother and sympathised with her and could not ask anything from her, not even school books or uniform. To get money for buying the things that I needed, I would accompany the older kids in the village to some sugarcane plantations about 14kms away. We would wake up very early so as to reach the farms before sunrise. We would buy sugarcane which we later sold in the village and made profit.I would buy sugarcane at 20 shillings and sell for between 80-100 shillings. I did this during holydays and by the time schools were opened, I would have enough money to buy my school books, uniform and give the remaining to my old grandma which she used to buy food. So early in life I learnt how to cook, fetch water from the lake and the river and to fetch firewood from the bush. I even tilt our shamba(garden) very well. I did my primary education and passed. My aunt was impressed with my perfomance in school so she paid for my secondary education.After my secondary education, I moved to the city to look for a job. I got a job with company X as a messanger. I registered and took a course in accounting. I worked for the company for nine years. In those years I learnt the art of doing business. Doing the same thing at the same place everyday over the years became abit boring so I quit my job. I needed to do something more challenging. I registered my company, did some marketing and got my first orders faster than I had imagined. A problem then arose in the name of WORKING CAPITAL. I had to think fast and came up with the idea of including farming as part of my business. Farming needed less capital to start and I was assured of growth. I am a husband and a father to a five year old boy in class one. During my free time, I do exercise and read books. Everyday at dawn I either run 15kms or train with light weights before I start my work. Doing exercise has made my ability to work in the farm look very easy. I dont supervise the people who work for me, instead I work with them. I have also learnt much just by readinCyrrently I am involved mainly in agribusiness. I plant tomatoes, watermelon and vegetable e.g kales in a reasonable quantity. This I do under flood irrigation. I have got land through lease along the lake. Availability of water makes my work possible throughout the year.Apart from watermelon whose buyers come from far or neighbouring towns, the other crops have market readily available just within the area.I had never imagined that this agribusiness idea would be a source of income not only to me but also to other hundreds of people who earn their daily income from activities resulting from this business idea i.e transportation of farm produce. Working on the farm and selling products from the farm to make profit. My business is about the production of food and food is a basic need.The beauty about this kind of business is that I only plan as per the capital available to me. For every 30shillings I spend per plant, I get a gross income of between 80-150shillings or more depending on the law of demand and supply. The crops that I plant takes between two to three months to harvest. The cost involves purchase of seeds, land lease,irrigation,land preparation and tilting, weeding and even spraying.I chose this type of business because it needed less capital to start. The profit has helped me to purchase waterpump, irrigation materials, farm implements like wheelbarrows, knapsack sprayers. The profit also caters for my daily needs. I pay school fee, rent and bills. This business, even though still small, has made many others to look foward to it as a source of their daily income just like me. I am encouraged by the African saying 'the largest mogumo(oak) tree you see arround was once a tiny seedling that held its ground'.CROPS TO BE PLANTED1. watermelon 1000 plants2.Tomatoe 2500 plants(already planted).3.Butternut 500 plants The farm has been leased to me for  a period of 12 months and I have paid fully. Ploughing has been done and the first crop (Tomatoe) has been planted. WHY THE THREE CROPS?1. I have planted the crops for two years, acquiring the necessary skills that is needed to make them successful.2. I have created a market for the crops and the market is readily available. Immediately they are ready, my clients collects them from my firm. From within the community where I do farming and beyond, people have created small businesses for themselves by selling these crops.

I  offer transportation  to people  and goods from the farm to the market and from the marketto  the  farms. Most people prefer the services I provide, as  a  pulling cart  can  be  used  in  different conditions of roads  where vehicles  cannotpass.The business is profitable as  it only  requires  one to feed the animal  well  most  oftenly.  Risks include tire punchers, and death of donkeys due to pest and diseases attacks and changes in weather. In a month I usually use approximately of four thousand Kenya shilling to maintain a pooling cart and the donkey. I normally deworm the donkeys regularly and to buy some feeds additives to supplement their daily feeds. After providing the services and maintaining the pooling cart I normally get a profit of sh.10,000 that is the total earning 14,000 sh (minus4,000 expenses) in order to get the above profit.Im normally  situated  in a place  called  Waka centre where most farmers and business men and women  whocome  for  theservice  .On  average  Icharge  aboutkenya  shillings  500 on any customerwho hire my cart totransport  his goodsto  his place of  destination .At  times I chargeabout  1000 shillings if  the goods haveto be taken  foradistance that isgreater than 8  kilometres .If given  aloan,  Ican  buy  new  tubesand tyresforthewheels  andbuy much more feedstokeepmy  animalsstrong andhealthy.Dear Lenders,I will use 80% to cater for course of Plant Operator which is in demand as many of our county are devolved .With this skill, i will be able to pay my children school fees and manage to cater my loan without any problem.The rest 20%,will use to my progresive business of Dairy Catle together with donkey transport.By doing this ,my business we learn at good rate and my family will be comfortable to assist in paying loan during period which i will be at College.",0.38552672639705954,0.81386068441113546,1

I am 22 years old and a Ghanaian. I currently live in Abura Dunkwa in the central region of Ghana. i actually grew up in a orphanage center from the age of seven until i was sixteen . thus i lost my mom at a very tender age. upon living the charity center, i went and stayed with an uncle at Abura Dunkwa where i worked as a shop keeper at a local provision shop. three years ago , i started a local cyber cafe with just three computers. however in June of 2013, i closed the cyber cafe , sold off the computers to start the drug store business i am into now. i am a senior high school graduate. i have had a lot of  experience in this life. Having to grow up without parents and living in the charity with people who had the same problems as mine made me strong and to know that in this world i am not alone . i always express my heart warm appreciation to those who have helped me in my journey through life till this day. My aim in life is to become a social entrepreneur and grow my drug store business to a point where i can open many branches nationwide and help those in need. As a young man, my greatest philosophy is that : i don't need a job, all i need is a breakthrough idea and with the little i have start so far, if i keep going i will be come an inspiration to the many youth in my country and continent at large . The first loan i raised really did helped me. i then raised a second loan which help instilled much confidence in my business. All along i have a plan as to how i want to progress. so midway down the  repayment of my second loan, i applied to the District Clinic in my Locality to allow me to Bill prescription drugs as part of the National Health Insurance program. funny enough, they thought that i was too young to do a thing like that that but when they have come to inspect my shop and they realized it meets their standards, they were amazed. It was as part of their registration procedures that i had to travel to the  capital in Accra that i happened to meet with Taylor Hannah the zidisha country ambassador for Ghana. She is such a nice person. I was given the go ahead to begin issuing prescription drugs from the clinic. But i am taking it one at a time. I invited a friend from the center where i grew up to join me so i can give him on the job training and after some time when he has perfected, we will open another shop in the district for him to go take care of that one.I have such a big dream, but i am taking one at  a time, i am very hopeful even when against the odds that i have a service to humanity. I really wanted to maintain a 100% on time repayment rate with my previous loan but dealing with governments can be very frustrating and delaying at times and that did gave me a lot of headache, the bottom line is that i have learnt somuch through the process and now know how to handle such dalays so that it will not affect my rapayments with my current loan project.thank youI operate a drug store (mini pharmacy) on a very small scale. it is a licensed one . i sell the basic health care drugs like the paracetamol, multi vitamin capsules and syrup , pain killers and many more. i choose this kind of business because of the need for first aid drugs in my locality. on average, i make $20 a day before meeting Zidisha and the amazing lenders on this platform. upon coming into contact with you, lenders funded my loan of a $100 and upon taking new stock to fill my shop, sales jumped up and my daily sales increased from the previous $20 to $38 out of which 50% was my profit.  i did some savings and this also enabled me to pay back the loan on time as per the repayment schedule. i even adjusted the repayment at a point.today as i speak, there has been the commencement of a market that was under construction just at where i have my shop. and the issue is that all the other villagers that comes to trade do come to my shop to buy the basic first aid drugs for their households. initially, i wanted to go on trek to these nearby villages but since they have been coming to my place, i have to stop.Seriously speaking my drug or pharmacy business really require a lot of capital  but i am willing to always learn from small beginnings and its struggles.My business is a life saving one and i am so proud of the decision i took to go into that business although i did not know how i was going to grow. but because i had a greater why , today the Zidisha team and all the lenders have help me very much to which i am so grateful. i applied to the District Clinic in my Locality to allow me to Bill prescription drugs as part of the National Health Insurance program. funny enough, they thought that i was too young to do a thing like that that but when they have come to inspect my shop and they realized it meets their standards, they were amazed. It was as part of their registration procedures that i had to travel to the  capital in Accra that i happened to meet with Taylor Hannah, the Zidisha country ambassador for Ghana. She is such a nice person. I currently bill prescription  drugs to a number of people that the hospital will direct to my shop for their medicine needs. however i had to accept only twenty people in a day for now. so with time i will increase the number as i develop.When my application is funded, i will use $25 to buy two box of paracetamol syrup, each have 12 bottles in a box. then $20 for paracetamol tablets and $100 will be used to purchase other most demanded pain killer tablets and syrups for children and adults. As to how the addition of these new stock will do to my business, it will increase my profit at least 40% and will help fill the shop and to the society it will serve as availability of basic first aid drugs to the people which will go a long way to save lives . Although there will still be some deficits, it will go a long way to serve the community .",0.0,0.49419536931899916,1

I went to Kirangari High school for my KCSE (Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education). After my KCSE, I joined Kabete Technical Training Institute in Nairobi where I graduated with a diploma in Laboratory Technology. I am married with two children. I have worked with CAIS as a laboratory technician for 3 years, where we were dealing with production of bull semen and selling it to farmers for artificial insemination, so I have experience in dairy management and generally agriculture production.Besides working as a laboratory technician at Muruaki Secondary School, I am a farmer specializing in dairy farming in Kinangop. I also grow wide range of cash crops like potatoes, peas, carrots and cabbages. I am also a member of Tulaga farmers SACCO, where we sell our milk and get paid at the end of the month. Kinangop is endowed with weather that favours production of such cash crops and customers come as far as Nairobi.My income per month ranges from Ksh. 8,000 (USD $90) to Ksh. 13,000 (USD $140).  After deducting expenses, it amounts to sh 6000 ($70) per month as net income that I add to my salary at my work place for family upkeep and payment of school fees.I intend to borrow a Zidisha loan to increase my farming activities with the help of my wife, who is a housewife. With this Zidisha loan, I will be able to boost planting by planting in a land that is currently sitting idle. I live just some few meter from the Turasha River which, though seasonal, I will take advantage and water my crops during the coming dry spell. This will put me at an advantage, as I will not rely mostly on unpredictable weather. I also want to plant more feeder crops for my cows to boost milk production.From my workplace I have net income of Ksh. 14,000 (USD $150) and will keep part of my personal savings to go towards this project. We are approaching closure of schools, and I dont work during the holidays, so I will be in a position to set the ball rolling and, furthermore, this will be close to two months. I also dont work during weekends (i.e, Saturdays). Therefore, I will be having at least a day in a week to concentrate on my project.I do also have plans to purchase a simple water pump that will enable me do some irrigation to my crops, particularly vegetables and cabbages, which have ready market due to their ever-increasing demand. When prices go down, I will be using them as fees for my cattle and this will increase milk production.Dear lenders, with my fourth loan, I want to add another dairy cow to increase my production.Currently I am producing 12kg, which I use 2kg for home consumption and sell 10kg to the Tulaga farmers cooperative society at a cost of ksh 35 per kg, tabulating to ksh 350 per day. (The information above pertains the cow in the picture.)If I add a dairy cow, I am targeting milk production of 20kg for sale per day. This tabulates to ksh 21,000 per month minus ksh 6000 production cost: ksh 15,000 profit is left. The operating cost is minimal, as my wife is a housewife, doing most of the chores except during the weeding and planting season. During this time, we engage casual labourers who are readily available, I dont go to work over the weekend, helping my wife with farm work.Currently I am working as a lab technician at Muruaki Boys Secondary, earning ksh 15000 per month. In addition, I have an irrigation project, for which, thanks to Zidisha, I was able to buy a pump. I am currently able to irrigate  acre of land comfortably. Mostly I plant kales and cabbages, which I earn a minimum profit of ksh 2,000 per week, up to a maximum of ksh 8,000 during a dry spell.The cost of buying the dairy cow is ksh 55,000 (USD $600), the rest I will buy concentrate. With the above income, I will comfortably pay the loan. This project helps me pay for the secondary school education of my first-born child, who is in class seven, better still increasing family income.

I went to primary school in Kitale, I studied in  Uganda for my high school since the cost of joining high school there was cheaper and thus affordable to my mum.  I am married and  also a mother of two boys aged 4yrs and 2 yrs.I have not been able to secure a job since I completed my University course in 2013.My husband owns a barbershop and recently a car tracking business which i can say it is a family business. Due to too much commitment on the tracking business to stabilise it, the barbershop has been left to my management as he continues with the car tracking business.The barbershop is located in the Central Business District of Eldoret town in Kenya. it has been in operation since 2008 as the only family business that catered for all bills and basic needs. I am thankful that despite the challenges of the barbershop not being able to meet our needs 100% ,i can still count on it to produce more if a few changes are made to improve it. It has been a month since the business was handed to me and ghrough monitoring it, I can see their is potential if given some basic face lift like replacement of the shaving machines,obtain staff uniform, replace worn out towels and shaving gowns and even paint the premise which I feel are the major challenges. If am to get this loan I see the business on another level scaling upwards since i will have bought all the equipment that i need to improve on its standard and also meet the customers satisfaction.  I believe when a customer is satisfied with the services offered, they will be repeat customers and also will refer others thus increasing  sales and even better grow the business.I intend to pay the loan installment with proceeds from the barbershop itself and baking business that I do.Dear Lenders,I would like to thank you for the previous loans funded to me. It has been of great help.

Currently the charges are a dollar per customer to shave (Ksh 100) while my competitors charge between 2-4dollars. If able to bring a face lift, I will be able to increase the prices slightly too.Hopefully the above information will make you understand my quest.Stephanie Wanjiru",0.70315825724004921,0.51679804127517914,1

She was strong and hardworking and this gave me courage to move on and work hard even at  times when I was low. I never had a chance to see my father because he passed on when I was very young, only 3years old, but they never got married.Things were never smooth when I was a child.  My mum was the youngest in the family and a bread winner for her family. She would go out do manual jobs like washing clothes, cooking in occasions and cleaning houses to earn a living to enable her meet our bills like house rent, medical bills for her mother who later past on in the year 2004 and my school fees.Life was was very challenging in the year 2010 when I joined high school.  My beautiful mum had a serious injury on her right knee and this took three years to heal even landing her in India for a 3rd surgery when friends and relatives came together to raise funds for treatment in India.  It was a very trying moment for us when she was away in India for two months. Even when she came back from India in crutches, she would still go out hawking groundnuts on the streets to earn a living for us.  She struggled to see me through high school education and I did not disappoint her and managed to attain good results in my final year exams in 2014.  I attained  a grade  B  with 64 POINTS and was admitted to the university.Am now proudly ready to join university on 1st September, 2015.Immediately after my high school I decided to sell kids clothes, shoes and socks to earn  some small cash and support my mum. It is the norm for women get babies and so I felt children's clothes would sell faster. I chose to concentrate on selling  jumpers and sweaters since it was the cold season. My charges sweaters and jumpers range between 200 KES AND 300 KES while shoes sell between 250 KES and 700KES. Since I am joining university I hope to use my profit in assisting my mum to pay part of my fees. I understand her situation and know how hard it has been for her to bring me up and with her continuing struggle  she has still extended support from her meager income to her three adapted kids.She adapted three girls aged 15years, 13years and 6 years. I envy my mum's big heart and want to support her in feature after my studies.With Zidisha's support, I believe I will go very far in my studies and look forward to achieve the very best in my life.I want to buy required books for my studies, the books will cost me  upto 150$.

I am currently married with two beautiful daughters 20years and thirteen year old. Due to the passion for organizing cook outs and entertaining friends and relatives as one of my hobbies, I decided to seriously take up event organizing. Soon I started receiving requests from friends and relatives to organize functions. I bought 100 plastic seats and bought 2 tents for 100 and 50 seater  capacity for hire. We  have since been organizing weddings and corporate functions. I would like the business to grow since bigger functions will requires for items for an efficient function. I am glad that I am also getting more help from the family members, especially my daughter who cleared high school last year is very keen on the job and I would like her to take over one day as a source of income.My main goal is to be self reliant in future to minimize the cost of hiring. If I get the loan I will continue to purchase items that we use in the event industry such as  video camera, more seats, fabrics for decoration get new tents and catering appliances. This will cost me at least  Kenya Shillings 500,000 or more  in total. I am grateful to zidisha for the past loans that enabled me to buy two big  cooking pots and 10 more seats.  With my last loan I added 2rolls of fabrics that are used for decoration. I would like to increase my stock continuously. Since the event industry is quiet dynamic it is important to keep up with the current requirement. This is why I will always be buying current tents since or are now old and outdated.I am currently operating from the house it becomes very uncomfortable for both parties. clients must come home and view the items they are hiring. We also spend so much money on hiring of transport I would like to minimize on cost one of this fine days.I have already identified commercial places that can serve as both a storage facility and offices to give me a more professional outfit.  I always engage youth in the are from manuals jobs and if we are able to expand I will give opportunities to a few youth on a permanent basis . For now I will engage and work with my daughter who cleared high school and the rest of the family members.I would like to grow the family business, My daughter is very interested in events management and as a family we are very outgoing. I would like to encourage her and also engage other youth in the estate by providing job opportunities from time to time. My daughter still being a youth represents hope and through such jobs we will alleviate crime and other vices they are most likely to engage in the estate because of idleness. Since we cannot afford a good university for her for now, through this job we do together, our daughter will instill a sense of responsibility and be able to earn her own money and we will both save for her college fees.Since we are also a young family and still taking care of our siblings the job will be a source of training and skill acquisition. The skills applied are decoration from fabrics, flower setup, catering skills, photography, all these are necessary since our goal eventually is to be self reliant and reduce hiring charges of items.",0.0,0.60339969735900301,1

Where I live the land is very fertile, bcoz plantation usually do well with farming.I don't have them yet bcoz I'm planning to get married anytime from now, but when I get them I will teach them to follow my footsteps.My hobbies: I like watching movies, footballs, and listening to cool music.My cyber cafe deals with; General Computer Services, Photocopy services, Lamination, Book bindings, Research Projects & Proposals, and Computer Application Packages.My services are very useful to my customers, who always believe in my excellent job services since I started the business....because I work on my professionals. I choose this cyber business, because it is the work I do with passion...I really like it so much.My typical costs and revenue is between 40k to 50k every month to my business.To obtain the profit maximizing output quantity, we start by recognizing that profit is equal to total revenue (TR) minus total cost (TC).An equivalent perspective relies on the relationship that, for each unit sold, marginal profit (M) equals marginal revenue (MR) minus marginal cost (MC). Then, if marginal revenue is greater than marginal cost at some level of output, marginal profit is positive and thus a greater quantity should be produced, and if marginal revenue is less than marginal cost, marginal profit is negative and a lesser quantity should be produced. At the output level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost, marginal profit is zero and this quantity is the one that maximizes profit.Since total profit increases when marginal profit is positive and total profit decreases when marginal profit is negative, it must reach a maximum where marginal profit is zero - or where marginal cost equals marginal revenue - and where lower or higher output levels give lower profit levels.With my business profit - I always support family member e.g. Parents, Sisters, Brothers, Some other profits I use to boost my cyber caf business with reinvestment in growing the business with stocks, clearing the bills and other personal activitiesalso looking forward of expanding it to something big, because my dream is to become a very big entrepreneurs with Gods will, it is something I do believe myself since my childhood time.I always that no matter the hardships I face God has good plans to my life and nobody can change from me.Lenders, accept my special thanks for the generosity you all have on me. For accepting my loan proposal, I want to use my third loan to buy two computer machines, each machine will cost $300 so that my clients will get computer availability to use in my cyber cafe. I call upon all of the lenders to stand by me and support my business project for funding, because my vision is to succeed and help my entire community village which I believe I can do it, and I do promise never to let any lender down who support me with his/her money.

My clients have supported me through this journey and they have encouraged me to invest even more on mobile phones.  These phones are very popular in Kenya and their sales picks up towards the end of the year because this is the time most people have some money to spend on such items.  I am hoping to cash on this season and make some good profit. I will spend the money to buy an assortment of phones both low budget and smart phones so as to address the needs of all types of clients.  This will cost me about USD 400 and this will definitely contribute to the growth of my business immensely. Thank you.",0.54358612532919126,0.62802729980386118,1

I hold a Bachelors In Education from Nairobi university and due to graduate in August with a Masters from the same. After my first degree graduation, I took up a job at Lutheran World Federation as an Administrator in Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kenya. During my free time, I used to do Online freelance work that mostly constituted research. I decided to switch fully to this business after my Contract with Lutheran World Federation ended. This is what I currently do. I have been making the steps to formalize and increase productivity in my income generating engagement, utilizing the knowledge and skills I gained from Training and work to gradually perfect the art.I run a personal online research business. One of the aspects of the business is gathering of academic material, online tutorials and academic assistance to students. I research and report in various disciplines that include Education, Nursing, History, Business, Marketing, Technology and Natural Sciences among others. For every report generated per research, I get paid a variable cost per page that is calculated by the number of pages, discipline, complexity and academic level of the research. The main resources I utilize is an unlimited internet connection and a laptop computer. The main advantage of this business is that, besides the aforementioned  resources, there are no other major resources required, apart from research skills and academic knowledge. Besides regular internet and electric bills, there are no other major expenditures, increasing probability of profit. Typically, I spend approximately Ksh.8000 (90 USD) on associated bills. The income ranges between Ksh.30,000 ($290) and Ksh.40,000 ($380) every month. I use a significant amount of the income for bills and supporting my brother in college. I also manage to save some for future expansion plans.I intend to set up an office from where I will dispense my research services. Currently, I  work from the house if am not meeting my client. My help also works from his house and we coordinate over skype, email and social media, when he is not at my place. I have decided to work from an office where clients can come if I can't go to them, as an alternative and for convenience and trust building. I have identified an office at Lumumba Drive, Roysambu that costs Ksh.15,000 a month (Approximately USD. 150). To use the office one is required to pay 2 months deposit and a month of rent. I currently have in my possession office seats, a working table and office stationery. I also have a month's rent. I will use the loan for the 2 months deposit that totals to Ksh.30,000(USD.300).  I will also use the Ksh.6000 for the city council business permit. Having a physical and official working location will help me build more trust with my customers. It will also be positive for my work culture, discipline and daily production assessment. With higher trust, I expect referrals from clients for whom I have worked to increase. I will also be able to manage my work well with my help working beside me. I also intend to get a second employee and the work place will be appropriate for a growing team. The lowest I make for a research paper is usually Ksh.8,,000 (USD.80) and an increase in referrals even by one is highly sought after. I look forward to your support.

However I have been separated for 9yrs now.I have 2 diplomas,Electronics and Information Systems.At the time we separated I dint have a regular job but a small cosmetic/ beauty soap which was all I had to rely on.About 5 months down the line I sold the business and left for the neighboring country Sudan to explore for better business opportunity.My stay there was however terminated due to hostility in the area i was located, just before the Country was declared independent.I have since been doing supplies in stationery mostly in schools but only occasionally.I have thus indulged in poultry farming to diversify just to supplement what I manage to get from supplies.I have a chicken farm house for local chicken which I have been supplying to a hotel.I have 2 children aged 16 and 11 yrs whom am taking care of. My girl desires to be a lawyer while the boy wants to be an engineer.I love visiting farms and learning new things at every opportunity.My business of poultry has been doing great and the school uniform supply is still on. Thanks to Zidisha for the three loans i have gotten from them. I ve continued to do supplies  at the hotel and I just secured another supply order in a 3 star hotel for 120 pieces per week. Every other week I manage to bring in new chicks between 50 to 80.Out of the proceeds from this business, I did a course in sales and marketing costing235US Dollars. This course I took so as to allow me be able to do proper marketing and learn the sales skills, this will go a long way in helping me do business more professionally.From my initial involvement with schools, in stationery supplies, I have managed to source for school uniform supply from two schools, which I will do every beginning of the year.Being a single parent is not an easy task,it requires me to work extra hard to manage with the ever rising living standards. Globally the economic crises is biting in all countries Kenya not being an exception.I thus have to stay open to available opportunities.I have just secured another supply order for chicken for a 3 star hotel.They want 120 pieces of local chicken every week.however from my poultry house, I can afford to do about 50 which means I will have to out source the balance from other farmers.This is an opportunity that has come when economically everything is skyrocketing. This is from feeds,and so even prices for the chicken is not left out .1 piece of local chicken weighing 1.5kg is at 600KES ( 6 USD ). 70 pieces would be 42,000KES (420 USD ). The hotel is in return buying at 720KES (7.2 USD ) per piece. I will be able to make at least 1 USD profit per piece after the expenses. This will allow me to service my loan while I add on chicks I bring in weekly and eventually I can manage to supply from my poultry house. The first batch is expected on Saturday 25th July, which is only 3 days from now. I don want to loose the opportunity that has taken me 6 months soliciting for. Due to the urgency of the order, its my humble request to my Zidisha donors to grant my plea for the funding of this order. Due to short notice, am not able to finance the whole amount required prompting me to seek for funding from Zidisha.I am not the only beneficially of this opportunity but also the extra hand I will seek in labour and the other supplies (farmers).This is an order that needs running around and outsourcing to enable continued services and hopefully will do with this facilitation for am determined.Thank you in advance and my regards to Zidisha donors fraternity.NBDue to the on going Global Entrepreneurial Summit in Nairobi, there has been a lot of immobility due to visiting  American President Barak Obama since Friday for security reasons and the immobility is bound to last until he leaves the country. This has thus pushed my supply to next week. I wish to pay my gratitude to those who have already contributed towards my call for funding and plead for others to come forward and assist me that I don't loose the order.Today Monday I went out to source for local chicken from the suburbs of Nairobi to make sure once I get the funding I will have ready source. I have already identified 3 farmers with a regular supply ,seeing the days gone am worried, am here now beseeching my well wishers to come forth and fill in the remaining percentage. I will greatly appreciate the fundingThanking and honoring all the donors, its regards.",0.0,0.48489346126427457,1

I use the amount to pay for my bills boost my business and buying  fodder for my cows.In my third loan, I want to concentrate with production of feeder crops, dairy feeds are expensive and having improved the breed and constructed cattle shed, my focus will be on how I can reduce the cost particularly on feeds. In 1 month, the cost of feeds is about 100 US Dollar(1 bag every week) I sell milk at US dollar 0.4 The cost of feeds are therefore high and reduce my income. If I cut on the cost, I will be able to save about US Dollar 50 on feeds only. In my 2 acre farm, I dont cultivate annual crops since they take long without returns. I usually concentrate with short term cash crops e.g cabbages, Kales, Potatoes and Tomatoes. Maize production has greatly been affected by a mysterious disease which authorities have not addressed to date, so I decided to carry out wheat farming in a 4 acre farm that I have been renting in the past 3 years, after wheat harvesting I store the Hay for feeding my cows. I want to have additional 3 acres in which I will plant Oat and Lucern which I will plant twice in a year and store it to be used during dry spell, Months of January to May are harsh and dry. With enough feeds, milk production will be on the rise and am convinced that sales will be high hence high  profits.",0.39234904603557624,0.74595712849593099,0

Todays children are tomorrows future, they hold the future in their little hands, what we give to them today is our tomorrow and a little seed becomes a tree of flower. A week before resume from the Christmas holidays to the school to teach, I went to one of the village called Nkosookrom in the Sunyani Municipality to visit my stepmother. And I found that, the children of that village need educational foundation for their future, because there was no any single school by then, they even havent had a dream to get school at their village. So it kicked my heart and made up my mind to establish a new school for the children, and as we all known, education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom. Therefore, I did not have any right to do anything by myself, so I went to the following elders at  the village, Nana Afrifa Agyei, Nana Rose Adu, Nana Kwadwo Ntim and Mad. Joyce Kaakyire to discuss about the school and how it may be established, and they were so glad. Many thanks to the above mentioned names for a free land they gave to me to established this school. Now the school is successfully established CHILDREN ARE TOMORROW FUTURE EDUCATIONAL COMPLEX (CATFEC) by the name. I am currently managing from Kindergarten one (1) to Class five (5). Some villages nearby parents are bringing their wards to this noble school to build their foundation. Now I have employed five (5) teachers. Respectfully, I called all the parents to informed them about the fees and they agreed with me to pay it accordingly. As I am speaking now, the school is well managing, improving and precisely as well.Since this school established till now, it is well known across Nkosookrom village. So I am pleading to Zidisha and dear Lenders to support me to buy school bus, it will enable the children to come to earlier, I will also need your help to build new block rooms, school chairs and any other school materials. And I hope this will make them feel comfortable in this noble school. Because, I asked myself that, its not easy to establish a school, so where I am going to get a fund to support a little I have for this school and someone introduce Zidisha for me. So I have a strong believe that, Zidisha and dear Lenders will give their highly support and help these children of CHILDREN ARE TOMORROW FUTURE EDUCATIONAL COMPLEX.

I practice my dairy farming in Bomet county where i focus on keeping dairy cows for production of milk for sale and breed the rest of the cows for sale.Am currently in the process of expanding the size of the farm in order to have it as a full time job as i have to keep another job in Nairobi so as to sustain the dairy farm. Its full potential has not been realized and therefore have to continue investing for the next few months when the cows calve down and start producing milk. While away from the farm, I also offer badminton coaching services. Sports coaching takes place in tho exclusive clubs in the Nairobi's park-lands area.My main source of income are from the dairy farm and also the coaching services. I make an average of between US dollars 200 and US dollars 450 per month depending on the month. At the moment, the net returns are mostly invested back into the dairy farm in order to aid the current expansion.Most of the other income come from the business of buying and selling of badminton sports equipment which include badminton rackets, shuttles, grips and racket strings.My intention is to fully commercialize my dairy farming business so that i can fully settle into the farm and focus in the commercial production of milk for sale. My other major source of income will originate from the sale of cows to other farmers.My small dairy farm has had a very positive impact since I started partnering with the Zidisha team.At the moment I am keen on managing dairy feed preparation systems in order to reduce feed wastage.. Currently, I use a small sized chaff cutter( A two rotary blade chopper powered by a gasoline engine) machine to chop fodder for the cows. The fodder is in two states. The green( maize stalks for silage) and dry ( baled hay and straws) fodder. However,  my chaff cutter does well with green fodder as it cuts through the maize stalks easily and efficiently unlike with dried grass(hay). Chopping hay with it results in lots of wastage as the blades slides on it instead of cutting through it. The resulting chopped hay is in varied sizes. At the feeding lot/ trough, the cows choose to eat only well chopped( small chop size) fodder leaving the part that rolled through the machine.Solution.  To avoid such wastage, I am seeking for a 75000 Kenya shillings ( Approx 750 US dollars) loan to invest in a new gasoline  engine powered hammer mill machine. The hammer mill is very efficient with chopping fodder, especially the dry fodder( hay and barley straws). That will in effect dedicate the chaff cutter machine to only chopping green fodder at the farm. Overall effect at the farm is efficient feed preparation systems leading to less wastage and better returns in the milk production. I thank you all lenders for your continued support. Looking forward to a positive feedback once again as I seek grow my farm.Thank you all.",0.57731423413323613,0.7980233799566111,1

However I have been separated for 9yrs now.I have 2 diplomas,Electronics and Information Systems.At the time we separated I dint have a regular job but a small cosmetic/ beauty soap which was all I had to rely on.About 5 months down the line I sold the business and left for the neighboring country Sudan to explore for better business opportunity.My stay there was however terminated due to hostility in the area i was located, just before the Country was declared independent.I have since been doing supplies in stationery mostly in schools but only occasionally.I have thus indulged in poultry farming to diversify just to supplement what I manage to get from supplies.I have a chicken farm house for local chicken which I have been supplying to a hotel.I have 2 children aged 16 and 11 yrs whom am taking care of. My girl desires to be a lawyer while the boy wants to be an engineer.I love visiting farms and learning new things at every opportunity.My business of poultry has been doing great and the school uniform supply is still on.

Every other week I manage to bring in new chicks between 50 to 80.Out of the proceeds from this business, I did a course in sales and marketing costing235US Dollars. This course I took so as to allow me be able to do proper marketing and learn the sales skills, this will go a long way in helping me do business more professionally.From my initial involvement with schools, in stationery supplies, I have managed to source for school uniform supply from two schools, which I will do every beginning of the year.Being a single parent is not an easy task,it requires me to work extra hard to manage with the ever rising living standards.

After trying all sorts of jobs and seeing I was not successful I started a charcoal business three years ago. It was easy to start since in our home we had a lot of bluegum trees and so I started as a charcoal burner. I could burn charcoal and sell to buyers who were locally available although they didn't buy at a good price I was happy since I had a business to rely on and mostly with good income and no bosses to supervise me.I started my business three years ago when I had no idea of anything else to do this was because I was tired of working for other people in my village and this made me to try my luck in charcoal burning business using some trees in my fathers farum it was not that easy but I thank God that after so much struggle I managed to establish a firm network between the burners and retailers ,in Nyeri county it is a very cold area since it is between the aberdare ranges and the slopes if mt Kenya this means that a lot of people use charcoal to warm their homes mostly the ones in the urban areas and this makes the product a first moving product ,the only problems are transport and lack of customers .I have contacts for some retailers in the nearby town where I supply them in wholesale and they sell in small quantities. One bag costs 800ksh in my village and I sell at 1400ksh in town ,plus a transport of 150ksh this means that if I buy a bag of charcoal from other burners I get a profit of 450ksh,sometimes I sell two or three bags depending with demand. I believe that i f I can get financial support I can be able to get more customers and that way maximize my profits.I am requesting for a loan of 23828ksh  to buy more stock of charcoal for my store which i am to open by the end of this month , this will help me to add more profits since i have been just selling to the retailers in wholesale currently plans are underway for a new stall where i will sell in wholesale and also in small quantities this will probably double my current profits if all goes  according to my plan, i am also looking forward to purchase my own motorbike  in the near future",0.67956947497198084,0.71269312085874836,0

I started this business to address the  need of hygienically prepared food because I realized that the people who were doing it were not observing basic hygiene and that led to many would be buyers shying away from home made snacks. Due to my brief experience in working in hotel industry, I had an edge over the competition and I also took my work very seriously.

I am married to Mr. Olela Odongo of Kasgunga Ward in Homa Bay County. Our marriage is blessed with six children (4 boys and 2 daughters).  Am the 2nd born in a family of 6. Grew up in a rural set up hence adhered to the hard times and tough conditions but I thank God I made it through. Attended primary education in my rural village of Mihuru in Homa Bay County hence started having a keen interest in owning up my own business in future. I did not continue with my education after sitting for my primary education final examinations in 1980. I got married and since my husband was unemployed, we had a good opportunity to start an income generating activity that could financially support our young family. This is what led us to start small-scale poultry keeping in mid 80's and we have done it on a relatively small scale but on a sustainable basis to date. My hobby is watching  nettball and visiting the needy in orphanages and hospitals whenever am free.I am doing poultry rearing (indigenous chickens for meat and eggs laying). The business has been facing a series of challenges due to chicken sicknesses and lack of chicken vaccinations. I am seeking a low interest loans to enable expand my business and do a profitable venture as there's a huge demand of eggs in my Mbita community as this is a fishing community and eggs are in high demand.My eyes are still set on my long-term goal of being one of the major egg producers in my locality. I will certainly not be able to realize this goal without continuing to expand my business. I now have 150  chicks that I bought and have started to lay eggs that I supply to local hotels and other establishments with a good return. It is for this reason that I want to expand my business further to meet demand for eggs that I know for sure will still grow.I now wish to  improve my old dilapidated chicken house in which I will be able to house a big number  of layers. This is with the aim of realizing my long-term goal of being one of the major egg producers in my locality.I am seeking a loan of KES 57,018 to enable me buy 8 Bags of Poultry Feeds at a cost of KES 3,800 x 8 = KES 34,200, Vaccines at a cost of KES 3,000 and solar heating system at a cost of KES 20,000.With the adequate poultry feeds and solar powered system for my poultry business, I will be able to keep more birds and re-sell them at a very competitive pricing due to heavy weight and quality of eggs. The increased profit will be used to meet University Education for my last born daughter.",0.80484147889826696,0.0,1

I live in Burgei village, rongai in Nakuru. I am a secretary by profession where i work in a secondary school. I hold Diploma in Business Management, Certificate in Secretarial and Computer studies.Despite the monthly salary I earn it could not cater for my needs therefore I engaged in farming where i majorly deal with dairy cows.Indeed the project has really assisted my family but much has not been exploited due to lack of enough funds to widen the scope.I have 3 dairy cows with some heifers. Each cow I milk approximately 8/9 litres in the morning thus giving the total of 24 litres @27shs (though the prices keep on fluctuating.) I therefore earn Ksh648 on the lower side x30days=19440.After deductions of the expenses incurred for treatment, and feeds the profit is about Ksh. 10,000.Diseases e.g East coast Fever which is common in our place is a serious drawback of this business despite the cost of treatment which is costly sometimes it leads to the death of a cow. Also fluctuation of price of milk is a very serious challenge since one cannot plan ahead or budget for the income expected.Thirdly, drought normally affects the dairy cattle since there production becomes low hence need for enough storage of food to cub the problem.Since the project has not been exploited well due to funds i therefore request for funds in order to do it to the fullest by using a zero grazing method which is  normally very productive.I will therefore use the funds to construct the structure for the 3 dairy cows and employ someone to assist me in achieving my set goal which I believe it will be highly achieved.To this far I thank God that he has enabled me to complete the two previous loan. I believe that my vision of venturing fully into Livestock farming will be accomplished.Three weeks ago I Managed to buy 1 acre of land worth 4,591.63 USD of which I will use it to grow fodder for my dairy cows. Though challenging I will have to work hard to achieve this project. Thanks so much for Zidisha team and those who lend me money which has surely placed me in a position where I can repay my loan comfortably.The Loan which I will get will now place me in position to work on my 1acre bought farm to do as stated above to boost the productivity of milk. Within 6 months I will be in a position to cut the fodder which I believe it will have reached its maturity. The balance of the amount will be used to hire someone who will assist me to work on this shamba for more production.I will surely let you know every step of my progress.

I live in Eldoret Kenya.  I have a passion for photography. I come from a family of 6 kids and being the first born of the family, i have always had to find ways to earn some income to support my self and help my siblings. My passion for photography started after high school when i took my father's analogue camera and started taking photos door to door for money. I managed to earn some income but then i joined the university and therefore stopped for awhile. The passion in me did not die so i went on and  found a job in an organization that dealt with video shooting, editing and photography. I not only gained skills experience but i also managed to save some  money to buy myself a camera. Mid last year, i quit my job to start my photography business. I now have a small studio in town and i have managed to create a client base and create a name in the photography industry.My business offers the following services, wedding photography, Events, family shoots,model shoots and portraits. Eldoret town is just opening up to the idea of using professional photographers to create beautiful memories of special days and loved ones. This is a great opportunity for my business to meet the demand and grow. I offer creative and professional photos to my customers and i have managed to gain the trust of the clients i have worked with before to appoint of getting referral jobs from them.However,  my major challenge is equipment. Photography gear is very expensive and i need to buy more equipment for my studio and for my outdoor jobs to be able to meet the level of professionalism expected from me. It will also help me venture into the corporate world which require proper get tenders from them.With the loan i get from Zidisha, I plan to buy professional lighting gear for my studio, an extra camera for big jobs and accessories  from my camera such as lenses. I will highly appreciate the loan to be able to boost my business.This is my second time to apply for a loan. With my first loan, i purchased a white backdrop for my studio which helped me save a lot because i stopped hiring one. I managed to move to a bigger office and i am happy with my business so far. However, there is great need for me to market my business. This will not only help me get more clients but it will also let clients know about my new location. My marketing strategy includes printing business card for distribution to potential clients, make a pull up banner with my logo that i will put at the entrance of the building my new office is located, create a portfolio of the work i have done for presentation to clients, print stickers with information about my business and what i offer to be put in strategic places where many people can read it and pay for one week of each month to promote my page on Facebook which should increase the number of likes i currently have. All these will cost me about 220 US Dollars. I have currently saved 60 US Dollars for marketing purposes and i need the remaining amount to implement my marketing strategy. My dream is to see my business get to a level where the income i make is enough to buy equipment for itself and  I am confident that by the end of the year i will have reached so many clients and my business should be able to bring in a lot of income. Kindly help me achieve my dream.",0.54170118162725422,0.71256059134231897,0

The climate of my country is very favorable to agricultural breeding.I gave myself to the breeding of sheep since 2013 until today after receiving training in breeding for a year. I'm proud of myself because the income earned by myself helps to pay school fees for my brothers and solve some problems of my family. Every six months I buy new sheep. When I buy a sheep at 35 000 CFA francs, I can sell it in six months at 125 000 CFA francs to 150 or to 150 000 CFA francs.

Life hasn't been easy, but I've never given up because I'm determined to be educated. Sometimes I have to drop from school, though, to help mum in selling to get money for my fees and my chop money (money for daily provision of food is called ""chop money"" in Ghana).

He has been initiated from an early age in the use of trees. Although his father was attached in the first place to the values of nature he accepted to send his son to school. Moussa Sanou has thus studied until the 5th class of secondary school. Following the death of his father, he was obliged to quit school at once but he continued to discover the forest, together with his uncle. He was very ambitious to earn a living and he tried several jobs. That is why he passed through the GENICA to work as a lab assistant at the institute for veterinary science and why he worked at the Red Cross from 1979 till 1999.The urge to care for patients with the help of plants will lead him to an old man with an exceptional knowledge about therapeutic herbs. When he left the old man he had improved his knowledge a lot, which allowed him to become independent in this domain. He hasn't taken a lot of time to proof his knowledge: he treated a lady from Benin which payed him the trust of her husband who has been teaching him a lot more secrets about herbs. From one success to another he gained his excellent reputation also outside of Bobo-Dioulasso and even over the national borders. He became part of the group of the best traditional healers and he followed several trainings to still improve his medical forces.These proofs will quickly convince the actors in the region and he is elected the president of the association of traditional healers in Houet (ATTPH) ""La sagesse"" (The wisdom) in 2002. His motivation and his wisdom have allowed him to choose a new direction for this sector in the Houet-region. A small forest has been created in Lguema, with the support of Mr. Olivier Marc and the Ministry of Environment. The participation of the association in several exhibitions and fairs has been awarded several Prices and Certificates. Moussa Sanou is a very popular traditional healer and he works with the help of three youngsters to assure his succession.In orde to assure that his wisdom will serve humanity in the future, Moussa Sanou would like to build a laboratory and write a book with all the recipes for therapeutic herbs. The president of the ATTPH does his best to provide irrigation in the forest to create better conditions for certain plants which will treat other illnesses. We can say that Moussa Sanou is a specialist in: pediatrics, cure of haemorrhoids, malaria, sexual weakness, diabetes and several others.The enterprise I have created is located in the neighborhood called Djaradougou, next to the Centre Muraz and not far from the big mosque. We provide traditional health cures. Our aim is to promote health for everyone through the use of therapeutic herbs, to cure certain serious illnesses that haven't found a solution yet in conventional medicine, to help those patients who don't have the means to pay for care by modern medicine.My health center receives around fifty patients every day. The influx of people asking for our services is due to our competences, the quality and the low cost of the care provided. The social character of our services for the population allows us to create a difference. It is my ambition to enlarge the enterprise through the creation of several production and selling units for traditional medicines in each neighborhood of the city and each capital of the province. In this way I hope to secure our achievements and to stay ahead of my competitors in the sector. In general we have a monthly income of 1 million 2 hundred thousand (1200000) Francs CFA representing the turnover of the business.With the loan, I intend to continue to take care of the grove by bringing new varieties of medicinal plants and to continue research in the characteristics of plants that will allow me to help more my patients. The continued production is essential. For this, the supply of medicinal plants always remain at the heart of our occupations .____ Thank you and have a great day!",0.45299498668654142,0.0,1

I went to school there growing up in the rural part of Nakuru. Life was a different experience because my family did not have much in terms of money, so going to school was a struggle: my fees were never paid on time, and I didn't even have enough exercise books to write in, so I would use one book for two subjects. I used to mix English and maths in one exercise book: I would start maths from the front page and English from the back, and when the teacher asked why, I explained but they said that is unacceptable, so I would pluck some pages out to recreate another book, or I would borrow pages so that I would create into an exercise book.We only had one school in the neighborhood that was a government school. For me, it was 8 km away going and coming back home, so I walked 16 km a day for over 14 years. When it was raining that was the most difficult time: no shoes, no umbrella, so I used to cover myself with a hard nylon paper or sack.My business is a dairy shop. In Kenya, we have two types of milk: the one that is packed at the factory and the one that is sold straight after milking the cow. This one is for the people who are not well up financially.In Kangemi, a slum in the outskirts of Nairobi, I have a a kiosk called Hassam Milk Shop. From here, I sell milk in small quantities. Ninety-eight percent of slum dwellers cannot afford packet milk, so they buy milk in small quantities. To get my stock, I have to wake up at 4 a.m. in the morning, go to Limuru (which is more than 10 km away), and get back by 6 a.m. to open my shop, which is along Hinga road.I have faithful clients who never disappoint me: they buy from me because of the quality of the milk. I got into this business after I got stuck in college. I didn't have money to pay my college tuition fee, but this business got me back on my feet. The profits I make go back into the business. They also help me pay the shop's rent, my house rent, my son's fees, and I also depend on them for a livelihood.With the help of the loan, I will be able to buy seventy trays of eggs per week from the farmers as I go for my milk.One tray of eggs from the farmers costs $2.70 US dollars. The price of the same tray in Kangemi is 3 dollars. The profit is $0.30 dollars multiplied by 70 trays per week: this gives $21 dollars.I intend to increase the trays I buy gradually.

Due to lack of finances, I have been passing through challenges but all in all I have managed to survive. The uniqueness about our land is rocky.

Clear Business Proposal I deal with various projects. Apart from being a teacher of the word of God, I do small businesses like selling clothes and a school for the orphans.I sell clothes worth Ksh 20,000 equal to 200 US dollars. I therefore need the loan to expand the business in the way:1.Ladies clothes worth Ksh. 10,000.2.Childrens clothes worth Ksh. 5,000.3.Mens wear worth Ksh. 5,000.Ifgranted I will multiply each item by atleast two to three times.The school is under financial strains since it supports orphans and less fortunate/privilladged in the community. The school needs the following items that we dont have:1.Infrastructure i.e. we use rental houses and we need to pay rent. We pay Ksh.2,000 for rent per month equvalent to 20US dollars.2.The teachers need to be paid and each teacfer gets Ksh. 2,500 equal to 25 US dollars. We have a total of two teachers.3.The school text books for each subject and each class. The books range between Ksh. 250 and Ksh. 800. The subjects taught are Mathematics, English, Kiswahili, Science, CRE and Social studies. So far eachclass, we need approximately Ksh. 10,000 equivalet to 100 US dollars.4.Lunch programme since most learners are orphans and less privilladged. We provide break tea and lunch. In a day we spend Ksh. 500 equivalent to 50 US dollars twice a month, we provide the leaners with foodstuffs to take home.Therefore, I request you to kindly grant me the loan since thje project that I get from sale of clothes in what keeps the school and the church running. I therfore need to expand the clothes bussines and enable the school to also stand on its own. Somethig Interesting or MemorableA SCHOOL TO SUPPORT ORPHANSI have started a school to support orphans and the less fortunate in the community. The school runs from baby class to Nursery. It is situiatd in Serem Sub-location, Shamakhokho location, Hamisi district in Vihiga County. Currently it has a total of 50 pupils. The name of the school is El-shaddai ECD. The main problem we have is financial starins since most learners dont pay, w hav a difficult time in paying our teachers, providing the necessary requirements for the learners including feeding programme. I have a total of 2 teachers and getting a salary of Ksh 2500. We lack text books and infrastructure like enough desks. Some of our learners need support at home and so we offer food supplements to them.Sometimes when the community supports us with the material things like clothes, we give those that totally dont have.I may have spoken more words describing what i will do with this money if given and i still can repeat by saying that in the event am granted the first amount of money i will boost my business by buying some more cloths to add up on what i already have.this being the month when people in our country buys cloths more than any other season,i believe i will make a lot of money and eventually repay this loan without any problem.I also want to let you know that in my area i will be your ambassador.Many people who will here of you will most likely wish to associate with you for a better future.Let me pray that this is not just another dream but a dream come true.God bless you and am waiting to here from you.",0.44641268949914259,0.40509803236599573,1

I am  a second born in a family of four. I underwent  my primary education in lower solai in nakuru and later joined Lake Nakuru secondary School. I am single with two children one who completed her secondary education in the year 2012. I started selling Charcoal in Kiserian in Nairobi, then I was selling charcoal to kiserian town residents. Later I relocated to Kitengela where cost of operation was low. From my previous charcoal business, I was able to purchase a plot in Nkoroi area near Kiserian and constructed four room residential houses. I have rented this rooms though they are are still incomplete therefore the rent income is abit low. However they have been of great importance to me since I was able to educate my daughter up to form four level. The income from my business was also used for family upkeep and helping my parents back home. I also have interest in farming and have been doing it in my home place where i have rented a 1 acre of land in bahati nakuru and have been planting wheat and tomatoes and the returns are encouraging.The main product i sell is Charcoal. The demand for charcoal here is on the rise since its affordable to the population around. With a group of about three, we hire a lorry that transports the product rom Narok where we obtain the the charcoal at a lower price. Charcoal is sold in bags and a bag goes for Ksh. 700 from the supplier. the same bag I sll it at Ksh. 1500 minus Ksh 150 per bag that I pay for transport. this brings a profit of about Ksh. 650 per bag. I also sell the same in small quantities and this is where its more profitable than selling in whole sale. A bag may result to about Ksh 2000 when sold in small measurements. In a good day, I can sell up to five bags while in other days i can selljust one. On average I do sell about bags at average of Ksh 1000. This translates to an average income of about Ksh 40000 per month and after paying all the expenses (Rent, security, labour e.t.c) I have about Ksh 20000 which is Net profit and I use the money to pay for my family upkeep, school fees and the rest to savings account. I am not the only supplier of this product. we are about 5 in the neighbourhood and most of the time we work together especially during purchasing so that we increase our bargaining power and reduce the cost. I have my regular and permanent customers whom i even deliver the product to their homes so that to maintain a good relations and make them loyal.With my third loan, I  to concentrate much on wholesaling. Our major supplies are from Narok County, this will require adequate storage space and adequate finance to cater for both bulk purchasing and transport.  Currently I have a semi permanent shed that I have been using for both retail and wholesale. I have  identified a trusted person who will be in charge of retail as this is more demanding since most customers buy a bag or less.While out there, I want to deliver as much as I can to those customers that so far rely on me. I have once delivered to far places like Limuru and Kinangop. This however can be more profitable if am delivering more bags as opposed to few since overhead costs are high. I am exploring possibility of soon delivering regularly to far places like Limuru and Kinangop and Naivasha after I obtain the licence to do so. I have confidence in this business having been in it for long and I am aware of the challenges. Also I have made several long term customers who are reliable. My future plans are to acquire own means of transport as transport costs reduce profit margins. I am hopefully that with your support, this initiative will be a success.",0.63174542196689509,0.73532884206413918,1

This is about 200km from our capital city. I am 40 years. I ventured into poultry business after working in a few companies which were often being closed down due to recession and I decided to venture to self employment.  I plan of starting to venture into dairy industry and I plan to buy about 2 cows at first and progressively expand, but that is a story for another day.I am married to my loving wife Mercy and we have two daughters - Kathy and Emmy, Kathy is 6 years and is going to school and Emmy  is 4 years, she joined baby class this year and she is very excited about the new school!My first bone daughter Kathy tells me that she would like to be a pilot and Emmy says  she would like to be a doctor when they grow up!I love travelling and and nature expeditions, I especially ornithology - birdwatching very much.I am a poultry farmer from Nakuru - Kenya. I normally keep free range chicken because they do not need much and are resistant to most diseases.I have a total of about420 chicken currently and I started with slightly less than 200 when I join Zidisha, through the loans that I acquired from Zidisha, I have been able to expand my business progressively.This has turned out to be a full time job for me and I have even employed one person to be assisting me.The project has not only made me be able to put food on the table, it has enabled me to take my young girls to school but also made me realize that in everything we do, so long as we are dedicated we can make it.My goal is to be able to supply chicken eggs and meat to my immediate neighborhood and eventually open up my business to include incubation and chicken feed formulation.My next ambition and challenge is to venture into dairy farming that is by buying a cow or two so that I can sell raw milk and later I can do value addition by selling yorghut and cheese.The profits have been increasing steadily and this has enabled my wife also start her own clothing shop in our neighbourhood.Hallo to all the Zidisha Team and all the lenders. I am very happy beyond what words can express to let you know that I have just completed paying my third (3rd) loan for buying a water tank.The water tank has been of tremedous benefit for me and my family as this enabled us to collect safe drinking water at an arm's length. This obviously reduced the waterborne diseases like diarrhea and cholera.The second and most important was that my poultry business improved because at no time did my chicken lack water. This in turn increased the number of eggs/birds and the growth rate was very fast and I was able to make more profits.I had projected that I wanted to have about 300 chickens by the end of 2016 but, I would like to report that by June 2016 I had 420 mature chickens and lots of chicks. I therefore collect approximately 8 trays (240 eggs) of fertilized eggs on a daily basis.Most of my customers have been asking why I do not sell them chicks as they would like to emulate my project. This has therefore made me to request my fourth (4th) loan for the purchase of an Automatic Egg Incubator. This is to make my business an All Round One Stop Shop for Poultry from eggs, chicks and chicken meat.Most of the eggs are bought by customers out of town for consumption and incubation. The rest, I normally hire an incubator and after hatching them, I sell one chick at $1 as opposed to selling 5 eggs at $1.However if I get a loan from Zidisha, I will have economics of scale and be able to sell most of my eggs as chicks which is value addition, depending on the market forces, this will be a profitable business.The type of incubator that I intend to buy is the 1056 Automatic Eggs Incubator. The number 1056 is the number of it's capacity of eggs but you only keep about 176 for one row or 352 eggs for two rows every week. This incubator adjusts it's humidity, temperature, turn eggs and you can be having chicks on a weekly basis depending on your customer demands.After I acquire this incubator, I will now venture into another project; as the saying goes you do not keep all your eggs in one basket!I therefore take this opportunity to kindly request all the lenders to extend your generous hand and lead me the loan of $800.The loan break-down is as follows:-1. Cost of Incubator...........................................$7002. Electrical wiring,switch and socket..........................$803. Miscellaneous expenses........................................$30TOTAL:.........................................................$810",0.61493053826773769,0.94436690645680332,1

I have been doing poultry business and I also own a shop that sells purses and handbags.  I want to rear goats. Kenya is an Agricultural based country. Goat rearing does not require much land and do not bear high cost to run. The site of the project will at a small land owned by our family. I will purchase does and bucks of one year of age so as to maximize on the loan.Goat farming requires less capital and investment than raising any other livestock. I will start goat farming business with a very small investment but in the result I will get more profits than any other livestock.I will earn some extra money by selling manure to crop farmers who use goat manure in their field because it is a very high quality organic fertilizer, I will sell goat meat it has a great demand locally and this rate is increasing rapidly day by day, I will sell goat milk is enriched with many necessary nutrition elements and it is easily digestible which makes it a huge demand locally and also goat skin has a high demand and value locally.After the goats have reproduced, I will sell young ones at a profit in order to maintain a healthy  maximise on the profits.The profits will be used to take care of my family,  siblings and my dad.From the requested amount of USD 377.85:Goat housing will use locally available materials which are affordable to construct a suitable house for profitable production at USD 19.78. The house will keep the goats healthy and free from diseases.Goat purchasing will use USD 138.44 for four meat goats both a doe and a buck(Boer breed). Two milk goats will cost me USD 158.22(Toggenburg breed).In feed management, I have a grazing place where my goats can roam freely. In this system my goats will get food from natural sources and it will also reduce my food cost. Health and care will cost USD 29.67 because I want to raise my goats hygienically and seek the services of a veterinarian doctor to prevent them from various diseases. However, goats are less prone to diseases unlike other livestock.The remaining amount from the loan will be used in transporting the goats to the farm.Breakdown:1. A kilo of goat meat will sell up to USD 4.9. A 1 year old goat will weigh at least 60kg.2. A young one of a goat will sell upto USD 49.44. Boer goats are polyestrous (they can breed throughout the year), they can reach sexual maturity at 5 months of age. A typical breeding program is to produce 4 kids every one year and four months; meaning the does are pregnant for 5 months, nurse their kids for 3 months, and then are rebred.3. Manure will sell upto USD 9.89 a bag of 70kg.4. A litre of goat milk will sell upto USD 1.48. The two goats can produce a total of 10 litres of milk per day.Dear Lenders kindly support this project and thank you in advance.",0.20247195198972209,0.77468943560402437,1

Being a young lady, i believe that old age will never catch at me before i acquire what i have always had a  dream for. My entrepreneurial dreams and passion begun manifesting themselves at a very early age while still in primary school. This got to my parents attention when they realized that any coin i would receive from them, i always thought of how i could buy ice creams and sell to my fellow pupils at a profit during break time. In the evening, for instance if my parents gave me 10 KES to buy cake for break time tea, i would come back with about 15 KES. This went on and on and from that time, i have tried a couple of business entities. My current business is a Cyber cafe shop and i wouldn't call it ' a small shop' as people are used to. Instead, i always call it a mega enterprise that is on the right path towards acquiring that status. This is from my optimistic nature in everything that i do and the progress that i have seen in the business. The business is located in Kiambu County in a town called Kimbo close to Nairobi Institute of Business S studies (NIBS) Ruiru campus.I have a cyber cafe business located close to Nairobi Institute of Business Studies (NIBS) Ruiru campus. The business is about one year old and it has been through various challenges but that have never been a valid reason to cease from striving to achieve my dreams. Currently, the business is doing good and am proud of it. This has given me the courage to expand it by adding some new items and more machines. Being at a strategic location, close to a learning institution, i always receive a good number of customers most of them being students. The small nature of the business in terms of the number of the machines poses a challenge to my business in terms of losing customers. Therefore, i wish to buy some more equipment which i believe that it will lead to improved customer service provision.I am kindly placing this loan proposal in regards to the above subject. I have a cyber caf business located at Kimbo near NIBS. The business is currently undergoing a challenge of insufficient equipment following the rising number of my customers. Most of my customers have always requested me to add on more computers and printing machines to save them from the delay they undergo waiting to be served. I have been saving money from the profit I get to try and fulfill their request. Since I dont want to lose my customers, am striving to get money and purchase those machines in the soonest time possible. This will also lead to expansion of my business. Satisfying my customer has been my key priority since they are the ones who will determine the success or failure of my business by either opting to be consumers of my services or consuming the services of my competitor. Therefore, I request the amount stated above from the zidisha lenders and this will be of great help. I am aware of the zidisha terms and conditions regarding the loan and promise to abide by them.

On joining, the retirement benefits of my dad were out so he paid without any problems. Since at that time he had stopped taking alcohol. I didn't score well during my form four examination thus i could not have joined University but i joined a polytechnic course and got a course in knitting clothes.

I am the third born in a family of six children. I grew up with lots of challenges during my childhood. One major challenge was a lack of food and fees. I struggled through primary school, walking long distances just to attain education. I passed well and an aunt sponsored me through secondary education.After completing my secondary education, I joined Kisumu Polytechnic for a diploma in business administration. I looked for a job but was not lucky. The is when I decided to start farming so as to be able to take care of my bills before I can get a job. I borrowed $100 from my aunt, bought seeds for cow peas and planted in half an acre. I sold it out and made $130 in three weeks. It dawned on me that I could make much out of farming if I gave it more attention.I have expanded my farm to have 3/4 acre, and planted various types of [plants]. Among them are cabbages, kales and tomatoes. I tend to use organic fertilizer more as I focus in organic farming.I am an athlete and, whenever I am not in my farm, I am out there training. I believe I am a talented athlete. I run to national levels for my school and college.I do vegetable farming in 3/4 acre of land. I plant my vegetables in an open field and do irrigation to protect them from harsh weather. I also do mulching to protect soils from losing too much water. I produce high quality vegetables, and this has always given me a competitive edge against my competitors. The demand for vegetables has risen in the recent past due to declining agricultural land, growth in population and lack of technology adoption to produce more. I actually started farming as it was the only option with better returns and less start-up capital.My monthly income average is $320 and my typical costs are $150 per month. I use my profit to pay fees for my siblings, buy basics for my aging parents and save for my degree.Hello lenders, I wish to borrow $100 so that I can use it to clear another 1/2 acre plot. I would use the $60 I will receive to clear the land, till the land, and buy seeds for tomatoes. Since it is a virgin land, I expect to use little organic fertilizer. The new farm will add my revenues by 30%. The will help me save more for reinvestment in the farm and technology adoption.Thank you.",0.81406432882078417,0.68641194200038447,1

I was so serious in life, although I was a child. I gave very little chance to unnecessary gossip. I was stubborn a bit based on my mother's unacceptance in my roaming or going out. I also thought it to be right due to my interest in football. I was good and like football but they never allow me to train and advises me to concentrate on my education. Also, born into the royal family, I was always advised to lead a clean and healthy life.I grew brilliantly in school. My parents unfortunately left me at 12. My parents' death should have given my  weathy uncles to help me but it was the adverse. I sufferred really. But as the Lord wills, there was a little door opened for me. I was supported by my uncle who was not much resourced. He helped me complete my SHS education which was a great blessing to me. I had to hold my own hand after completion of SHS. I started pupil teaching which was not enough to support my tertiary so I started publications. I write pamphlets and novels. This allowed me some funds to enter into the tertiary institution through distance. I have now lost all my capital for the publication which was helping me in education and life.

U publish my own books. The books I have written on my own. I write books. I write and publish pamphlets and textbooks for teaching. I also write and publish story books or novels. I distribute them to schools. Pupils buy, the school also buy copies for the staff as they find it useful. I write science pamphlets, English pamphlets, both grammar and composition. I also write Twi and RME pamphlets. In fact the business is good. And you know a business grows fast and well when you spend time to generate it. It is so helpful and has helped my life a lot. Students cannot learn without textbooks and pamphlets. So our pamphlets are always in need. I write good books so it's always accepted.Actually I chose to be a writer because of my background, as a language student and my interest in reading and writing of novels. In a nutshell, it's because of educational background and interest.Cost books depends on the materials used, number if pages, size if the book and number if copies being made. Normally I make thousand (1000) copies before publishing again, when needed. Estimating, this may cost about GHS 3,000 and after selling, you may generate about GHS 6,500. Yes. Its quite profitable but it needs much time and dedication. This profit, when got, it is reinvested  into the business. This us to enable it grow. My child's education also benefit from this fund.

Again, I will need to employ people for the forming or first production. The above listed items will cost about $155.00. Beside these inputs or expenses, selling or distribution also entails a lot since I don't have my private van. I will have to hire a car to convey the books and move to all sales points until I finish the selling. this also can cist about $60.00. Because of the time I spend in my business, I am able to generate some high profits after each sales. I do benefit a lot from this profit. This money will help me in my education. It will help settle my fees and debts both in school and  at home. My son's education is also a priority. From this my family will also get settled financially. It's a helpful business, I testify.In case u get enough funds to increase my production, the business increases and does my profit as well. So my profit will surely increase. And this will enable me produce more and live better. My problem now is that I need some extra funds to support mine to expand the business.

My father was a milk vendor while my mother stayed at home to take care of her three daughters. As the first born in the family, I learned to take up responsibilities at a tender age. I attended a local primary school called Inooro Primary School where I faced numerous challenges. Since the income from milk business could not meet all the needs of the family, I had to spend my weekends in other people's farms where I weeded for a little pay. The money I got helped in meeting some of the family's expenses. As a little girl in primary school, balancing time for studying and working was very difficult for me. At school, the accumulating fee balance caused my being sent home on several occasions to the detriment of my academic performance. Nevertheless, I gave myself hope on realizing that some of my classmates were facing worse circumstances, yet they held on. I also resolved to make painful sacrifices for the sake of my future and that of my two younger siblings. As years rolled on, the generosity of well wishers and the hardwork of my parents facilitated the completion of my primary school studies. I was amazed to realize that my grades qualified me for a place in Weru High School. In spite of this great achievement, I was perturbed by the financial situation at home. This, however, did not kill my hope that one day, I would become a reputable lawyer and change the situation at home for the better. Moreover, lawyers in my community are considered to be the most learned professionals besides being the liberators of the oppressed. Miraculously, I happened to qualify for government bursary that covered a huge percentage of my tuition fee in high school. This turn of events pushed me to bury myself in books and do what I needed to do to keep my prospects of becoming a lawyer alive. My dream of becoming a lawyer some day remained valid, at least for the entire high school period. Once I received my grades, I was overwhelmed to discover that I had made it for a place in the college of my choice. One problem though had refused to go; the monster of lack of funds came back to haunt me. From one government office to the other, I sought financial assistance, but all I got were promises that never came to pass. Two months after the deadline for admission had passed, it dawned on me that I could not join college at that point in time. The next thing was to travel to the city and look for work so that I could assist my parents in educating my two sisters whose fee balances weighed heavily on the family's finances. Two weeks after arriving in my aunt's house in Nairobi, I was lucky to secure a job as a cashier in a busy supermarket. I learned a lot about the logistics involved in running such a big business and developed an idea of setting up a retail shop and grow it to the level of a supermarket. For the two years that I worked in the supermarket, I was able to save quite a bit of money for starting my own business. In addition, I helped my parents clear my sisters' fee balances thus enabling them to join high school. It is nearly 2 years since I started my business, but the challenge of sourcing for funds to expand the range of products has persisted. Nevertheless, I am hopeful that through the help of Zidisha community, I will make tremendous progress in growing my business. During my free time, I like participating in online discussions that touch on the various socioeconomic issues facing my country and Africa at large.The name of my business is ""Discount Shop"". This is a retail shop that deals in a wide range of food products such as eggs, rice, milk, bread, maize flour, juices and cooking oil. In addition, I sell laundry and bathing soaps, as well as detergents. The business is located in a strategic place along Patanisho Street in Kayole town in the outskirts of Nairobi City. I chose the name ""Discount Shop"" because people in Patanisho area like comparing prices in different shops before making their purchasing decisions. As such, the name creates the impression that I offer discounts on the products I sell and thus should be the place to come for shopping. I chose this location because the area is highly populated by middle and low-income earners who make small but many bits of shopping throughout the month. In other words, there are many customers who depend on my shop for their daily needs. This is unlike rich estates where residents do their shopping in large supermarkets and malls in the capital. I also chose the business because it has enabled me to have a flexible schedule. In addition, the business generates good profit besides improving my skills in the areas of time management, organization, and management of funds. The typical costs of my business include the cost of restocking the shop as well as the cost of transporting the stock from the wholesaler's premises to the retail shop. On a weekly basis, about $120 may be spent on buying new stock. In addition $5 is spent on transportation in a month while $45 is used to pay rent for the space being used by the business. The other expense is the cost of electricity which amounts to about $3 in a month. In terms of revenue, my business generates monthly revenue of about $450 out of which $200 is the net profit. Part of this profit is reinvested for the purposes of growing the business while a considerable percentage is put in a savings account to be invested in a future project. I also send part of the business proceeds to my parents to help them meet some of their expenses.If my loan proposal gets fully funded, I intend to use the first loan to meet the demand of two main products which I have not been able to stock well due to lack of funds. Out of the $200, I plan to spend half of the money i.e. $100 to buy a large stock of pishori rice which is loved by the area residents. $10 will be spent in transporting the rice from Mwea where it is grown and sold much cheaply whereas $90 will be spent on buying the rice. As such I will be able to buy about 129kg of pishori rice at almost half the price that suppliers sell.The remaining $100 will be spent on wheat flour whose demand within Patanisho area has continued to increase due to the many hotels and individuals who have specialized in cooking chapati. Since there are two types of chapati on high demand i.e. white and brown, I intend to spend $50 to stock my shop with whole grain wheat flour while the other $50 will be used to buy a large stock of refined (white) wheat flour.With such a large stock of pishori rice and wheat flour, customer satisfaction will get a major boost as I will meet the high demand of these products in my shop. As my customers become happier, the shop's profit margin will increase tremendously since the stock will have been bought at discounted price. One month after the purchase of this stock, I anticipate the net profit to increase by about 20%. Such positive results will have a huge positive impact on my level of savings and level of reinvestment. In addition, I will be able to repay the loan promptly.",0.0,0.0,0

A big spacious refrigerator in the market now is going for $450, and it will require to be secured with a  lockable metal cage, this will cost about $110. This brings it to a total of $560. This is because customers are really demanding these drinks at temperatures lower than room temperature. This will increase sales since we always turn away such customers. This will also increase our profit by about 10%. Am looking forward to working with you guys. Thanks in advance and God bless you all.",0.7505205231171389,0.77231339180285619,1

The business has been in operation since then through hard work and support from family and friends.  I am based in Mombasa but my family is in Western Kenya where I visit them once in a while.My business deals with office equipment particularly photocopiers and computer printers.  I also sell toner and ink cartridges for printers and photocopiers.  I have one worker who helps me in the workshop and to run errands. I make a net profit of about $300 and an injection of $150 that I am requesting will go a long way in expanding my business.My short term plan is to start selling photocopy paper which is in high demand locally and later on move to computer accessories.As aforementioned, my work involves refilling printer cartridges with toner.  I normally buy used toners at around 2USD, refill them with toner and then supply them to clients.  The process involves opening up the cartridge, cleaning it and replacing some parts if necessary.  The cartridge is then refilled and sealed ready to be delivered to the client.  This can cost anything between $10 to $30 depending on the condition and the capacity of the toner.  However the process is not always 100% successful.  The failure rate is about 30% and the only way of ascertaining that the toner is working is by testing it using a printer.  Unfortunately, the toners are not of a standard type and there are almost every printer uses its own unique type.  This is where the challenge lies since I sometimes deliver the cartridges without testing them first only for them to fail on the customers desk.  This not only embarrassing but also wastes a lot of my time (some of my clients are about 50 kilometers away) and even worse spoils my reputationThere are five common types of printers that are used in this region but I only have one type in my workshop.  If I am funded I am going to buy 3 more printers for testing my finished products.  These printers sell for $300 each; however, I am buying them used from another refilling company at a reduced cost of $180 each. They are lightly used and come with all the needed accessories.I will use any remaining amount to buy more used cartridges to recycle.",0.50783186270410074,0.44417922927436809,1

I am married with two children. Currently I am employed as a civil servant in Nakuru County.Despite being employed, I noticed that I could not meet all my rising needs thus I decided to engage in Dairy farming and more so though difficult I bought 2 plots. My main target is to start building rental rooms and I have started by buying materials i.e. stones worth US 1,041 from my savings. God willing I intend to start this work before the end of this year, of which after completing I am sure to reap good money.As indicated in my story, I engage in dairy farming which earns me some income which caters for some needs and bills e.g water and electricity. I also do some farming for my home consumption.My anticipated rental rooms which are on a prime area i.e. Nakuru-Eldoret high way will give me enough income to cater for my childrens' school fees and to expand this business by buying other plots for the same.To rent one room costs Ksh. US.23 x 10 rooms = 230 per month for 1 plot. Therefore If I finish the two plots building it will earn me US. 463  per month. Of course this is good money even to repay my loan and have extras.The challenge to this project is now the money to buy cement and for the mason.Before I finish these rooms I will use my salary to repay my loan.Already I have bought  nearly all the materials required for my rooms. I would have started it but I need to build the toilets first as this is a first priority. I have budgeted it to use close to USD 906.2 for the quality toilets and the bathrooms (8 in number). I will therefore start with the loan you will give me as I top up with my August salary and the savings I have. The completion of this project will open my way in proceeding with the construction of the room. I have already bought the plan and I hope all will be well before the end of this year.",0.29428872205095891,0.46861219470649473,1

After learning a few tips from those who were already in that field of fish supply, I went out to market my product. At first, the business has been tricky where I made a few losses, but now it is picking gradually. I like business ideas groups were we share information, motivate each other and on how we can empower the community. Apart from business, I like much of outdoor activities, watching documentaries, technical things and participating in community activities. I like children, and it gives me pleasure to go and show love and have quality time with the orphans and rescued childrens in childrens homes.  Im a friend to two childrens home where I occasionally spend some time with those children.I am business of supplying fish and chicken to small and medium Hotels and restaurants in Nairobi. I supply; fish fillet, whole fish and chicken products. I started to supply one small restaurant with fish, a month later I managed to get three more restaurants to supply. I realised that there was a huge demand for chicken and chicken products where I added chicken to my list. Most of the small and medium restaurants prefer to buy their food from small suppliers. The small suppliers, supply more fresh goods, can deliver small orders, are timely and flexible as compared to big established companies which tend to be rigid; and have standardized stock.  When the supply is abundant, the price goes down and that is when the profit margin is big on my side. After deducting all my expenses and cost of good, Im left with some reasonable profit that is enough to carter for me and have some to re-invest in the business. Some of the challenges I face are like are; When a customer fails to pay on time for the good delivered; A customer cancels the order after purchase but before delivery; When the supply of goods in the market is very low while the customer places a big order; Traffic jams delay on the road when going to make delivery of goods to my customers. Despite all of this I still do manage to meet my obligationsI want to introduce the selling of fresh, fish float bladder/fish maws in my business.  There is a great demand for fresh fish maws I would like to tap into this opportunity, which is quite promising in returns.I plan to use the money received as following:-Get a license from the ministry of fisheries, which cost $20,In a week, I'll buy  around 30kg of fresh fish maws worth around $551Cleaning, sorting, transport and packaging will cost me US $ 10. The remaining $83 will cover any unforeseen expenses that may ariseAfter sorting and cleaning, I will be left with between 27-28Kg of fish maws. Sell the 27-28kg  fish maws for around $ 750I have done my research, and interacting with other dealers and noted that this is a viable venture.

It is because of this that i suddenly thought the only way to keep my confident and work without the fear of being fired that the idea of self-employment hatched. i started dreaming of a company but all this was just like a mirage because i didn't know where and how to start since i could hardly raise money for my own food and other expenses even. i had to think very fast on the next course of action to take for my up keep before the land lord could lock me out. i started freelancing and i would find students then borrow a space and computers in town from my friends and train them from there. i would also trouble shoot and fix machines for a pay. After the election fracas that occurred in 2007-2008. i really was affected psychologically which also affected my job. The job became impossible and a friend of mine Eric Ouma who we used to work together in the institution and was now working in a supermarket in Eldoret offered to speak to his boss so he could agree to employ me in the supermarket which he did. Thanks to Eric because he was asked to call me and handed my CV over. After 3 days i was called for an interview where i passed. i started working there in IT department. i worked for 2 1/2 yrs. I relocated to Nakuru to begin a different life because the idea of self-employment was still lingering in me. Im now married to a lovely woman and are both pushing on to see what more life has for us. If all goes well i want to found a home for the less fortunate and other than my business.After resigning i relocated to Nakuru in July 2011 and started a business of buying and selling of Mali Mali (mixed small personal use items such combs, mirrors and other personal effects). I was doing all this with the hope that if all went well i would start my computer institution from the income generated by the business a dream i have always hope that one day shall come true. This however did not go as expected, the business did not do well and i thought it was all because of location. i rented different shop and still the results were not encouraging. It was at this point where i decided to close the shop. I closed the shop in August 2011, bought a small HP printer and then brought in a computer i had bought in the years  2008 and a the table in the house.i bought several plastic stools and i started doing printing and miraculously i got 1 student who paid for me to teach her. i she successfully completed her course and was happy that she could operate a computer by her self. She later brought her sister and i enrolled her and she also completed. i then managed to buy another small refurbished computer from the little i had secured. i did a small advertisement and i got 4 students enrolled for a computer application course. Since then i have managed to training over fifty students. i also involve myself alot with graphic design and computer maintenance. Though there are alot of challenges still i can stand a living testimony and a prove that one can start from no where, with the little you have to start. It is also very important that we dont loose hope and neglect our dreams. In future i want to own an institute a photo studio, a bigger and luxurious cyber cafe and a computer accessories shop. My main challenge to see this happen is a source of capital to buy the required equipment for all this.Hallo zidisha and the lenders, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued generous support to the needy. I want to reiterate my gratitude for the far you have come with me, thank you for helping me realize what would have other been a daunting task so easily. My next project is slightly outside business this time round. Back in piave (My home) there is perennial water shortages whereby every time the long rains cease people suffer because they have to travel long distances in search of water. My mother is now growing old and this is becoming a problem to her. I therefore have found it okay to put my whims aside however demanding and purchase her a plastic water tank.A 3000ltr plastic water tank is enough to take her about six months and it will therefore have solved this problem. The tank  costs Ksh 15,000-Ksh25,000 ($150-$250) depending with which manufacturer, the remaining amount will be directed on transportation, sand, cement, bush stones and the mason to put a stand. I urge you lenders to find it in your hearts and fund me so i can solve problem. I love my mother soo much if this problem is put to rest i know she will be the happiest woman. Thank you all",0.59287450384419971,0.21411053519902701,1

Due to that personal touch, my customers always came back and refer others to me.I have one employee who is always there to assist me when the customers are many.

In Ghana it is commonly found in sedentary workers like lecturers, bankers,lawyers etc. Therefore my vision is to promote good health and wellbeing among sedentary workers in Ghana and my mission is to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes among sedentary workers by providing periodic nutrition advice based on their anthropometric measurement.In order to achieve this I have to purchase a stadiometer, body composition monitor, and blood pressure monitor.Stadiometer is an instrument used to measure height Body composition monitor  is used to determine BMI, visceral fat, body fat, muscle mass and basal metabolic rate.Blood pressure monitor is used to measure blood pressureThe price of the  body composition monitor is 500 Ghana Cedis which is approximately US$130.The price of the stadiometer is 1200 Ghana Cedis which is approximately US$ 315The price of the blood pressure monitor is 250 Ghana Cedis which is approximately US$66.I will use 1800 Ghana Cedis (US$475) to pay my hostel fees for my last 6 months in school and use 510 Ghana Cedis (US$135) to pay the remaining of my last school fees in school.With the help of these instruments I will be able to promote the Sustainable Development Goal 3 which is Good Health & Wellbeing in Ghana.I have already written proposals to institutions that need my service and I have received a positive feedback. Thus I need the instruments to start work soon.I will employ two of my classmates who will help me in the taking of the measurements and the nutrition education. A fee of 5Ghana Cedis which is approximately US$1.5 will be charged after taking the measurement and educating every individual.The average number of people in an institution is 30. I am planning of visiting 3 institutions a day. Therefore, in a day I can make 450Ghana Cedis which is approximately US$ 118.",0.56947241246051605,0.64271341614147526,1

I went to Mama Ngina Primary in Nakuru and later schooled at Utumishi Boys Academy which is also in Nakuru County. I later joined Moi University in the year 2010 to pursue my bachelor's degree in Information Sciences.  After completing my course I decided to create a job instead of looking for one. So I started doing research in Agribusiness mostly because I wanted to utilize a small piece of land at home. I wanted to do something unique and so an idea of mushrooms came up and .-yes the idea was not very new but it was not common -  so I decided to venture into this business but it was difficult to come up with capital. So with the help of friends and family I was able to start. Since then I have encountered several challenges which led to the temporary halt of the business. Mostly I could not dedicate most of my time into the business because I had not finished school yet.  So the business without a doubt went own due to obvious reasons. Now that I have finished school, I would like to revive the business into operating full time. I am seeking capital to reinvest and I have actually found a way.  I am a freelancer, working online as a writer and again I seek to create employment for my fellow youth through this means. I am yet to start training of people willing to start working online in Nakuru County before expanding. Hopefully I will be able to raise enough capital to go back into Agri-business .I am planning to be a full time farmer and according to my production plan, I could be able to harvest 10 to 20 kilos a day.Mushroom farming is not very common in Kenya and they are a very unique plant. Mushrooms are not green, meaning they don't produce their food/ energy like any other plants therefore they get energy by feeding on already dead organisms mostly plants. They also require a certain type of environment which is modified to meet their specific needs. One mushroom farmer said that mushrooms are like domestic livestock because you have to take care of them but as much as they are like livestock, they need everything right where they are. Therefore, mushrooms require darkness and a lot of humidify in order to grow. Therefore, the best structure for them would be a mud house for a small-scale farmer like me but for large scale farmers, other specialized structures are used. Mushrooms are associated with several myths but the fact is, mushrooms are very nutritious and take a small period to grow: 21 to 30 days this makes it very unique because as a farmer you would start production in a short period. But there is much involved in the process of production. Mushrooms grow in two stages: incubation and fruiting, and the environmental factors involved in these two stages are different.  The material in which mushrooms are planted is called substrate. A farmer could prepare his substrate or purchase directly from institutions such as J.K.U.A.T. Also mushroom seeds are bought from the same institution for about ksh 1000 for each kilo. Each kilo if planted well could produce about 25 kilos. Basically there are two common varieties in Kenya but the most common is The Oyster which goes for about ksh 800 for each kiloI would buy three kilos of mushroom at around 35 US dollars. This would ensure that I have a consistent production plan which will enable me to harvest for a continuous period of time for several weeks before I purchase more seeds. If the seeds grow well I could harvest around 5 kilos everyday for a period of about  one month. A kilo of oyster mushroom retails at round ksh 800 i.e.  10 US D so that's around 50 US D everyday. I would definitely be able to repay the loan and even expand. My main objective is creating good value for customers and creating employment",0.0,-0.27970361530433091,0

I live in Naivasha town. I was born in Nakuru county in 1985. I went to flamingo secondary school and finished in the year 2005. After high school I went to Tracom college and  did a certificate course in business management.From college I got married. We have one baby girl.  In the year 2012,  I participated in the Value women  program and learned about the chicken enterprise. With the knowledge that I got from Value women program, I did a little research and realised that Naivasha  traders were buying poultry products such as eggs from neighbouring towns . This is when I came to  know that there was money in this venture.I then constructed a house and bought 150 day-old layer chicks costing Sh 100 each. I used local materials, wire mesh and iron sheets. Today I am happy as I have been able to sell my eggs and  support my family.I keep egg-laying chicken and sell eggs. I decided to do this business 2 years ago when I discovered how eggs were important and how scarce they were. I saw that gap and decided to fill it and doing it in Naivasha town  gives me satisfaction because eggs are on high demand. I sell to hotels in and outside of Naivasha town as well as local customers. My biggest challenge was finding clients. Now that I have loyal customers, I do not like to disappoint them.  I intend to grow this business and get many contacts whom I can sell my eggs to. I collect close to 4 trays of eggs every day and can sell between 5 and 7  crates weekly with a crate selling at Sh330. After subtracting all the expenses, I am able to bank close Sh10,000 per month.Today I am so grateful to Zidisha for the help that they have given me.  Through Zidisha loan, I construct a better chicken house with my first loan and  bought more than 40 chicks with my second loan. I  now expect more chicken out of the young chicks.  This will boost my egg production once they start laying eggs. Right now, my biggest challenge is  luck of  proper feeds for the chicken and the chicks. I wish to buy high quality feeds for both the chicken and the chicks.The feeds are well balanced and  will provide healthy  diet  for both the chicks and the older chicken.  I therefore appeal to lenders  to loan me money that will  help me buy chick mash for the young chicks and layers mash  for the chicken.  Your help will be highly appreciated.I want to take this opportunity to thank all my lenders for helping me build a  bigger chicken house that is safe for my chicken. With a bigger chicken house,  I would like to expand my poultry business by buying 30 more young hybrid chicks at a cost of $120 and a brooder at a cost of $35. The brooder will help by keeping Day old chicks warm  all the time. By adding hybrid chicks,  the number of  egg laying chicken in my poultry will increase with time hence I will be able to get more eggs for sell. In return, I will be able to make good profit by selling more eggs.",0.91009032452322913,0.70423221213085552,1

I am a 24 year old Ghanaian gentleman. I am a senior in high school seeking to continue my education. I am the second from a family of five. While in school and before going to the senior high, I assisted a friend who sold second hand clothes as a business. The quality and the beautiful nature of the products got me really interested and as such I started selling clothes to some friends of mine. Currently I work as a shop attendant to cater for some basic needs in life.My target is to be able to purchase clothes in larger quantities for sale to maximize my profits. I am very entrepreneurial minded and I make the most out of every opportunity that presents itself. Your loan will provide me the opportunity to improve myself and my business.I am a shop attendant who is also in the sale of second hand clothes or what one would call slightly used clothes. I have a lot of styles and design which people love to see and buy every day and this is generating a good profit for me and as such I want to expand my business and expand to other parts of the market and beyond and to also serve as an avenue to employ others who have no work to do. I currently do not have a shop to solely display these clothes but keep the goods at home and delivers them when contacted by someone for supplies and also during market days I take them to the market to sell which is every Wednesday. I however have a huge customer base who are always ready to buy from me. I would be glad to get this loan to be able to get access other available markets and also spread my tentacles across board in order to be able to fight the unemployment situation around here and also be able to make good profit so as to be able to pay back. I promise to execute and respect the rules and regulation of this noble institution. Thank you.I wish to apply for this loan to get more second hand clothes for sale. The previous loan went a long way in helping me pay my fees and some arrears. The second hand clothes as I earlier indicated is a very lucrative venture as almost as people in my locality resort to that when buying clothes. The loan of 800 GHS can help me pick about 200 pieces of the clothes and the expected income is about 1500 GHS. I promise to abide by all rules and regulations governing this firm as I did in my previous loan. Thank you",0.72994926054727083,0.0,1

I come from a humble family of 3 siblings .Thanks for taking your time to read through my Zidisha profile, apart from studies I have always had a passion for business. I have always been passionate in doing business and fortunately I have fallen in love with various business ventures since 2011.The types of business I do include sale of Laptops and laptop accessories, poultry farming and freelance writing. I have been in the electronics business which has been able to cater my expenses as well pay school fees for my younger sibling. I have also been doing poultry farming on a small scale and I need to expand the venture now.  The reason I have ventured in business is due to the high rate of unemployment in Kenya. I therefore decided to take lead in investing in small enterprises that can make me self independent and I do it till now. Some of my hobbies include reading, swimming, travelling and writing articles. I am also passionate about giving to the needy people and I have joined several charity groups to visit surrounding children homes near my hometown, we donate clothes and share meals while we are free to visit them. Currently, I plan to expand my poultry farm to 2000 chickens from the current 100.My poultry farm has been in existence for 6 months now. It has run from dec 2015 till now. I started with 50, 1 day old chicks. After 3 months I increased the flock to 100. So far I can say I have learnt the art of poultry rearing which was my major reason for starting small. I am aware of the Dos and Donts in the poultry farming having managed the exiting flock till now. Their performance has been quite interesting having recorded 0 death rate in the 6 months. Not even one single chick has succumbed to disease or any other condition; it shows the level of expertise and high management levels I have maintained. I am sure with your help, I can boost my business to the next level. My dream is creating a Chicken empire in the next one month. I plan to expand my poultry farm flock to 2000 chicks.When I get this loan 100$ will be used for expansion/upgrading of the exiting poultry house. This is essential to ensure the 2000 chicks get enough inflow of clean air and ample feeding space. The existing structure is able to hold a maximum of 300 chicks only.  With each chick costs 200ksh which is 2$ US, I will therefore use 400$ to buy more chicks to hit the total 2000 target. Some of the few coins saved will be used for transporting the chicks. 100$ will be used to buy drinkers and feeding troughs. These are very essential considering the number of chick intended to raise. A modern drinker system will also be installed within this budget to reduce contamination. 200$ will be used to buy feeds and medicine. Feeds are quite costly and in the long run I look forward to starting my processing plant to save feed expenses. Vaccines are very essential and will be offered on regular basis to keep off infections from the flock. I will top up the remaining 100$ with my savings to buy a 2000 egg capacity Incubator that will be used to hatch eggs in the coming few months when the flock starts laying. I intend to hatch and sell the chicks to my local community members at a fair price.This is the most interesting part of business, and shows how my business is quite profitable. Considering the hens ray with a success rate of 50%, I will be getting 1000 eggs in a day. In a month I will have 4000 eggs. Half of these will be incubated and sold as young chicks, each selling at 150ksh which is quite fair unlike other dealers who sell at 200-300. With 2000 eggs, being sold at 200ksh each I will make 400,000ksh. The rest of the 2000 will be sold as eggs, each selling at 20ksh bringing 40,000ksh in a month. It means I have a total income of 440,000ks in a month. 50% will cater for expences such as food, electricity, medicine and regular checkups from experts, transport and marketing. I will therefore be making a profit of 200,000ksh in a month. I intend to use online marketing using a website, SMS, whatsap and facebook Ads an art which has not been used by local farmers. I will also shoot videos and use pictures for marketing purposed while educating any potential farmers to join the lucrative poultry business. Please help me make my poultry dream business a reality.

I was schooled up to high school level when my Dad passed on while I was awaiting to join college. I was thereby forced to look for employment, which I swcured and used the income to pay for my university course (B.com - Finance). I managed to complete it and got a better job as a marketer, whereby 2 years later, the company downsized by retrenching a number of us. It is at this point that I chose to embark on an entrepreneurial journey, carrying out my own business ventures, to date.I have a son who wishes to be a pilot when he grows up. In my work environment, I am driven by the resolve of people working odd jobs in an attempt to fulfill their dreams.My hobby is appreciating nature. I love growing plants and keeping animals, which I do in the village, with an aquarium in my city dwelling.My current business is a combination of entertainment and essential service provision.I sell movies, both new and classic, which I purchase from distributors for resale to clients. Demand for this was realized on seeing that people undergo a lot of stress in modern society and seek an escape such as watching an appealing movie to relieve their stress. I also charge phones at a fee. With everyone having a smartphone that is always out of charge, I found it essential to provide a secure environment to provide this service. I also provide transportation services using a small multipurpose van commonly known as Toyota probox. This seems to be my main source of income, whih has prompted me to have the vehicle be inspected by the relevant government authorities, so as to allow the ferrying of both goods and customers legally. The law requires that a vehicle used for such service provision be inspected annually. I also want to make an addition to the car, by purchasing a strong roof rack, that will assist to increase the vehicle's carrying capacity. I have lost some jobs because this van is smaller than the one I had. Depending on the available funds, I am considering starting a photocopy business, that will be an all inclusive one stop office center.My typical costs are rent, purchases for resale, staff wages, electricity bills and vehicle maintenance costs.Proceeds from the business assist to pay for my sons school fees, as well as helping friends and relatives children go to school.Dear Lenders.My plan is to have the van inspected by the relevant government authority, so as to be on the right side of the law, thereby enabling a conducive working environment, to operate without fear or harrasment. This will increase turnover and therefore profits. Projections are at an increase of roughly 30%, as we begin, and possibly higher in future.I also wish to set up a comprehensive office solutions shop. This is an idea I know will work well, as it is an essential service and also because there is only one other shop that provides these services in the area. This service will help institutions like hospitals, schools and others, plus students nd individuals who require these services efficiently and cost effectively. I intend to beat the competition by good md efficient service provision, plus adding lamination, binding, typing, printing amd even web browsing, on demand, which are all services not provided by the competition. This will therefore be a new income source.Items to be purchased / paid for are as  follows;1. Vehicle inspection (booking and sticker) -USD 1502. Photocopier machine (second hand) -USD 3003. Laminator -USD 504. Stationery stocks- USD 305. Site renovation and painting - USD 100",0.54186020484318698,0.76477678298423468,1

I was born typical African family where I lived with my both parents and my brothers and sister all in one house.  I grew up helping my parents with their daily chores and went to school, first 8 years of primary school and later 4 years of secondary school.  I got married shortly after finishing my secondary school education.  I then relocated to Mombasa where my husband lived.  I started my married life as a housewife since my husband had a job and he was the family provider.  We were blessed with three kids  two girls and one boy.  One girl has cleared her school education but the other two are still schooling. Unfortunately the one who is out of school got addicted to hard drugs and she is now in a rehabilitation center.We lived happily as a family until 1998 when tragedy struck.  This is when I lost my husband and the father of my children after a sudden illness.  This crashed my world because I lost my companion and familys breadwinner.  With a very young family I had to think about their survival.  My husband was not a man of means and he did not leave much for us save for his three months salary which we got from his employer.I got a job as a (roadside) hotel waiter where I worked for a few months.  The owner was very abusive and the pay was very low.  I quit and started buying and selling second hand clothes.  I had a friend who was in that business and she taught me on how to run the business.I sell second hand clothes in an open market.  I normally buy the clothes in bales and then wash and iron them to make them fetch more money.  The clothes come from Europe and North America and they are very popular with the locals due to their good quality and friendly cost. I sell all types of clothes of both sexes and children.  This is business I enjoy doing because I have learned all tricks of the trade; moreover it brings food on the table and also gives me money to sustain the family.  I make a modest net income of $50 per week and the business has potential to grow much bigger if supported with credit like what I am applying for in Zidisha.I plan to expand my business by increasing my stock.  This will attract more customers to my business.  I deal with second hand clothes and I now want to venture into new clothes business. This way I will be able to attract a new class of people who do not wear second hand clothes.  Moreover, the government is phasing out importation of second hand clothes in the next two years and I therefore want to be ready for this change and this is my first step.Thanks.",0.77779535579113568,0.87955113386972295,1

I am a Christian born again, serving God under Top Hill Christian Outreach located at Kamukunji Estate in Eldoret, and also I am a treasurer of the same church.My business involves buying and selling of cereals, green vegetables, onions, tomatoes, and all manner of goods that are in demand around. I believe that food materials, especially the ones needed locally, will always be at a demand, so that is why I suggested to my husband that I start this business to help him in bringing up the children. It is a good business because raw materials are available locally and the market is also local readily available.The business will be profitable because most of the food I get from local farmers. The risk facing the business is lack of capital to stock enough. My typical monthly cost is KSH 25,000 ($255 USD), sale revenue is around KSH 15,000 ($153) and profit is above KSH 10,000 ($102), but I am planning to earn more given funding.I normally spend 50% of my profits supporting my family with emergency needs before my husband earns his salary, while 30% I plough back to the business. 20% goes to miscellaneous expenses and support of my aged mother.If given this amount of money, I will use 50 US dollars to build new stall structure for sales. I will also buy:1. Ground nuts - 25 dollars2. Maize for flour - 25 dollars3. Millet - 25 dollars4. More Irish potatoes - 25 dollars5. Tomatoes - 20 dollarsThe remaining money will go to transportation of these goods from the marketplace. This will serve my customers well and they will remain my customers for many days.If this proposal is complimented I expect my profit to increase by 50%, that is about 20,000 KSH ($204). If given this, I will be faithful in paying back the loan. God bless Zidisha.",0.78538226950548928,0.76767568774129147,1

I am a businessman in Muranga County in a place Mukuyu. Currently I am the manager of Mugoiri Modern Small-Scale Farming Organization (MMSFO) and I oversee the running of the project. As the manager I liaise with the Farmers Training Centre (F.T.C) and other stakeholders to train youth groups in agribusiness.  I am a very innovative and creative young man whose hobbies include swimming and playing handball.I founded MMSFO in the year 2013 and it empowers the youth with skills in modern small-scale farming. This project sprouted from urbanization and unpredictable weather patterns that have dealt agriculture in the region a blow in terms of low productivity. Urbanization has led to subdivision of once vast farming areas into small units of land that are unsuitable for profitable agricultural enterprises. In addition to this, the youth have a poor perception towards agriculture.The objective of the project is to deliver knowledge and skills in small-scale farming techniques to the youth while empowering them into capital intensive agribusiness and to enable them make more informed choices in agriculture for improved and sustainable livelihoods. OBJECTIVES1.To deliver knowledge and skills in suitable small-scale farming techniques while empowering the youth into agribusiness.2.To enable the youth to make more informed choices in agriculture for improved and sustainable livelihoods.MMSFOs ACTIVITIES The project involves setting up a drip irrigated model farm. Armed with this knowledge, the youth groups are in a position to liaise with the Youth Enterprise Fund intermediaries in their Counties for funding. The intermediaries carry out viability assessments for all proposed business plans.The training averagely runs for a duration of 1 week after where an evaluation is carried out to determine the level of adoption of new technologies among the youth. Productivity levels in the model farms are later assessed and compared with other non-irrigated farms where it is proved that drip irrigated model offers improved and sustainable farming and is profitable in terms of Agri-business.MMSFOs BENEFICIARIESa)Youth groups benefit through knowledge acquisition to make informed choices pertaining to agriculture. With this knowledge, they are able to seek funding from the Youth Enterprise fund.b)Any other parties with an interest in modern farming techniques are able to acquire the knowledge.The project is a step in the right direction towards creating employment for the youth, improving food security and alleviating poverty through Agri-business.a)Youth groups benefit through knowledge acquisition to make informed choices pertaining to agriculture.

Precisely sheep farming. I currently have 10 sheep and lambs. This has been my business for a couple of years now.  Sheep rearing is lucrative in my locality. A mature sheep can fetch about $60.00 to $70.00. And there is ready market available for my livestock if they are matured to be sold. I wish to expand my livestock farm so that I can have a lot of stocks for the market in order to derive some income but due to lack of funds this dream has not fully materialised.A careful cost analysis will reveal that, I spend about $20.00 - $30.00 on each lamb before it becomes fully grown.I wish to expand my livestock farm with more sheep. The purchase of more Ewe will help my livestock farm breeding process. With the help of a loan from Zidisha I will be able to expand my livestock farm to a minimum of 50 sheep in one and a half years. One Ewe for rearing can cost $35.00 to $45.00. I currently have 10 in all. The ten new sheep will cost $350.00 - $450.00.This expansion will also lead to the raising of a new structure (Pen).The loan will go a long way to increase my profit margin to not less than 100%.

When I was in class one my mother retired from work. And my dad was sacked. I schooled alone but my turning point was in form one when my mums friend used all the money they together with my mum had invested. Eventually I was in and out of school. I started business in school by selling an extra carton of biscuits so as to get pocket money. People in my area think that you need a lot of money to start a business but I started small and am growing. I don't have any children but for my niece whom I take care of, I would want her to become the person she dreams to be. Not e choosing for her. I believe that, that's what makes an all rounded person.  On my free time I prefer spending time with the less fortunate, giving them hope and sharing ideas of how to start small and grow. Specifically teaching children how to speak for themselves in a free societyI sell bread as a distributor, I have a boy who helps me distribute it who has a bicycle.  On a normal day, I sell 8 crates. My friend used to work for the bread company and she gave me the idea since they were looking for distributors and it had a good profit margins. I buy bread at 38 and sell at 43 making a margin of 5 shillings each. The bread company has a retention fee of 1 shilling so am left with four which helps to sustain me and my nieceI will buy a new bicycle and get extra hands soo that once the bread comes we can get to a more large area. Especially with the rainy season coming up, I would not like bread getting wasted or dropping in the mad like it happens. Also with the bikes we can deliver bread faster. Also get a small store to stock excess bread and service customers in the evening. Which in turn will help create a job and also grow investment.",0.0,-0.50991242370854861,0
