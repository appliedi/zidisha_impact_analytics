I live in Milimani, Juja, which is located in Kiambu County. I believe that I possess several qualities which make me uniquely qualified to contribute to the community. My educational background, which combines general knowledge with accounting, affords me an uncommon perspective on business.I am currently pursuing a degree in Business Administration at Kenyatta University in my final year. I also hold a Certified Public Accountant (Part II) and I am an aggressive business lady. My background in the complementary areas of business and accounting gives me a special perspective which I will pass to my fellow countrymen.I currently run my own business called NOMKUNGU BOOKSTORE that provides high school, universities and college students with the opportunity to buy, sell and trade used textbooks and school supplies. My business generates approximately $600 as net profit monthly. In a nutshell, I am an aggressive young lady whose intention is to make money and also assist others.My company, which is solely owned, deals with secondhand books and started in the year 2011. My companys name is called NOMKUNGU SECONDHAND BOOKSTORE and is a store providing high school, universities and college students with the opportunity to buy, sell and trade used textbooks and school supplies. In addition to textbooks, students may sell their school supplies like class notes, old newspapers, laptops, accessories or anything that they wish to sell or buy in my store. I used my own book collections as start-up inventory base. In addition, I talked to neighbors, friends and relatives, who donated some of the books. After making these rounds, I managed to get 4,000 books as start-up stock when I opened up for business. My companys goal is to strive to achieve the following:1)Become the leading secondhand book seller in Kenya2)Attract 500,000 customers in the next five years3)Achieve the target of 50,000 visits per month4)Establish sustainable profitability within the first five yearsMy company carries a broad and varied inventory of high school, university and college secondhand textbooks and other materials at all price levels and provides services to help students succeed academically and in an affordable manner. NOMKUNGU SECONDHAND BOOKSTORE generates profitable revenues equal to or exceeding national norms while keeping the cost of retail items competitive for high school, university and college students, and campus community members. I constantly seek to improve my interactions with customers and have invested a lot of time and resources in the business.Operating a used book store is a like owning a recycling center: it is not too glamorous but very profitable. My company generates almost $6,700 per year as net profit. I buy old textbooks averagely at $2 and sell them averagely for $5, therefore making an average profit of $3 per textbook. In addition, school supplies like class notes, old newspapers, laptops, accessories make a profit of $100 per month.My businesss primary purpose is to acquire inventories of used books from estate sales, new book retailer divestitures, and people simply seeking to sell their book collections. After receiving the loan, I will pay approximately 30% to 35% of the resale value of the book to the seller. At the onset of operations, I intend to purchase approximately 20,000 books and have them in my businesss inventory by next year. This will add extra revenue of 1,500 dollars a month to my business. I am also sourcing specialized software that will allow the business to easily categorize its inventories of used books while concurrently acting as a point of sale system, this requires about 400 dollars. I have already saved 200 dollars and will need the rest from the loan; this will enable my business to enhance efficiency. In addition, one of the most common trends in the book retailing industry is to maintain a section of the retail location that services coffee and small food products.  The margins earned from this segment of the business are tremendous, and it will ensure the profitability of the business from the onset of operations. I need approximately 200 dollars to acquire an extra licensure to serve coffee and small food items to the general public. Please fund me Zidisha.",0.52225337054744958,0.52225337054744958
