I would like to increase these profits to over $1000 a month.I have never experienced losses in my business venture and therefore, i am confident that any loans from zidisha community will be serviced from my venture.in case of uncertainties,then my salary will help me repay my loans till the business picks up.I intend to farm kales and spinach because they are in demand right now,they are being sold expensively because supply is very low and demand is very high,I intend to buy seeds worth $106,i also need to garden at a cost of $60,i have a generator that needs to be serviced at a cost of $120 this is to pull water from my well because its sunny,i need to buy herbicides at cost of $100,the rest i use to buy diesel for my generator,i  have a ready market for my produce since there are nearby hospital and schools.I will pay my loan through other established projects like dairy farming.",0.78368498647342355
