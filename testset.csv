I already have benefited from two loans from you people,thanks for that assistance.it has been of great help to me for i can now do farming in a more large land than when i started.God bless you with more.when i started asking for my first loan to be funded of $50, i was working on a plot(less than an eighth of an acre.after harvesting that period, i later moved to a quarter an acre land(leased) where after starting it with profits from previously funded venture,i requested a second loan of $196 which assisted me to boost my remaining part of the last season.Though i faced some hitch within the course of that project,i was able to reap big and now i can afford to do farming on one and a half acres of land all on tomatoes.it is a great wonderful feeling an am optimistic that this will be a good harvest for me come Jan/Feb 2015. i currently have 1 and a half acres of land on tomatoes and another 1 and a half acres on green maize too. I had estimated that my savings would cater for management of these farms but then other shortcomings cut short my plans.As i told you in previous loans that my dad has been ill for a while and am the sole breadwinner in my small family.Also rains are not sufficient as expected for this season.As i post this,we are preparing to lay my dad to rest as he passed on on 27th morning this month(last Thursday) on his way to hospital.we are on burial preparation.So i am posting this loan application to purposely boost my farming project in purchasing some pipe for irrigation,fertilizers and pesticides for pest control.the total cost for these material amounts to around $400 and the remaining amount will cater for emergencies which are usual thing in farming.like last season we had an emergent pest known as tuta absoluta whose control was expensive but through zidisha loan,i managed to control it.my dreams are to buy my own land after next year's sales and establish my home and farm since currently am leasing farms for my projects and through your sincere and never failing assistance,i am sure i will achieve my dreams.Thanks",0.5992998694181082,0.35782213776481714,1
